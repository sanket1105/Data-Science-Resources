" This is slightly different to the other reviews, please stay with me here.
",scottedwards-87359,26 May 2022,10,"If you were a late teen or in your early twenties in the mid 1980's the world was very different. No computers, no mobile phones, no internet, no DVD's. We had cars though, and bikes, and we loved them, and we loved films too. The original Top Gun captured this moment in time perfectly, and gave us a thrilling ride like we had never seen before. The humour, the games, the bikes, the aircraft and my word, those flying scenes. We went back to the cinema to see it again and again, and spent the following decades quoting the movie. As time went on, it remained like a static snapshot in time to perfectly represent that magical point in our lives for so many of us.Now, 36 years later, we are a generation that has lost our parents, we've had our own children who have moved on themselves, and we now approach the end of our own careers and our young selves are gone forever.This film is the missing bookend to that whole generation. The original was there for the start of our young adult lives, and this new film now marks the end. It's magnificent.I'm 55, but yesterday, just for one last night, I was 19 again. Thank you.","4,563 out of 4,779 found this helpful."
" The truly epic blockbuster we needed.
",Top_Dawg_Critic,23 May 2022,10,"Wow. The first Top Gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. The Matrix Resurrections. Well, this film just broke that theory.Aside from the adrenaline-pumping edge or your seat action, this story also had heart. It successfully overachieves, and surpasses its predecessor on every level.The directing by novice Joseph Kosinski was outstanding, especially considering this was his fourth ever full length feature film. All the stunts, visuals and V/SFX were breathtaking, and the camera work perfection, that you'll feel you're in the cockpit of the jet. The soundtrack and score was amazing. The 131 min runtime literally flew by with its spot-on pacing. I actually wanted to see more. Casting and performances by all were also perfection, and once again Tom Cruise reminds us why he is still one of the top actors in the industry.There's nothing I can critique or wish was better, as this gem was perfect in every way. Absolutely stunning, action-packed with a compelling and emotional story, as well as being a visual masterpiece. And the fact the dog fights were real and not CGI (actors had to train to fly the jets), just makes this film that much more magnificent. I'll be definitely seeing this again and adding the DVD to my collection. It's a rare perfect 10/10 must see from me.","2,417 out of 2,689 found this helpful."
" Let me just say...
",lovefalloutkindagamer,26 May 2022,10,"I was reluctantly dragged into the theater, thinking that they didn't need to make a Top Gun 2 and that the first one was where that story needed to end.I could write a couple paragraphs to summarize my feelings after walking out of the theater, but I'm going to leave it with just one sentence.I was wrong.

" Best Sequel yet
",goshamorrell,25 May 2022,10,"In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.","990 out of 1,157 found this helpful."

" This is why we go to the movies
",dtucker86,27 May 2022,10,"This is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. It was stuck in development ""hell"" for years and years. Then it was delayed by COVID and other issues. Its almost as if we were not meant to see a sequel to Top Gun. But now it is here and the question is, was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. This is the only sequel I have ever seen that i liked BETTER then the original. EVERYTHING about this film rocks! Tom Cruise is sixty this year but he can still do the job! He is awesome as Maverick capturing emotions and giving a performance that he hasn't given since A Few Good Men. You see Maverick's innate cockiness (something all fighter pilots have I'm sure) but you also see his vulnerability and his pain especially the scenes where he talks about his dead wingman's son and how he can't bear the thought of him dying as well. Jennifer Connally and Miles Teller give great performances as well playing Maverick's love interest and Goose's son. Yes you 1980's music lovers we get to hear Kenny Loggin's Danger Zone at the beginning it is wonderful nostalgia. Oh and I should also mention the aieral sequences are the best and most intense in movie history you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. To wrap it all up I wanted to mention the touching scene where Maverick goes to see his old Top Gun classmate ""Iceman"" who is now an Admiral and dying of throat cancer. Val Kilmer looks so bad because he has had throat cancer and can no longer speak well. The scene is so sad but they have a joke at the end where he asks Maverick who the best pilot is? Go see this movie by all means!",790 out of 924 found this helpful.
" Fake Imdb reviews artificially upping the ratings for this boring movie.
",imseeg,29 May 2022,5,"Almost 90 percent of all the reviews have a 8, 9 or 10 star rating! That's almost the same as for ""The Godfather"" (1972), which is a brilliant classic. It is simply IMPOSSIBLE that Top Gun gets the same critical praise as ""The Godfather"" (1972). Ridiculous amount of fake reviews!Mind you, I am a big Tom Cruise fan, I have seen all of his movies and I dont even hate this movie, I merely think it is a bit tedious. I blame the director (same as for ""Oblivion"").This movie has got 75 minutes of talk, talk, talk. The first half is a talking heads movie. We see Tom being a teacher talking to his students about FEELINGS and we get to see Tom talking/flirting to his former ex lover Jennifer Connelly. BORING.Skip the first 75 minutes, because only the last 45 minutes are non stop flying action.BUT... even the action is not very thrilling, because everything is so PREDICTABLE. I knew beforehand that every fighting scene Tom Cruise did, was gonna be successful. And it was. There is no thrill in that!The biggest hype of this movie was about the real life flying scenes of the actors. These flying scenes were pretty looking indeed. But did it blow my mind? No, it was even a bit underwhelming to see Tom Cruise with a helmet and mask on, trying to ""act"", without seeing much of his face. His face looked a bit bloated in his helmet. That's not great cinema...How they achieved to make such a predictable, tedious movie about fighter jet pilots, with so much money available? Well, that's Hollywood for you. Hurrah for Hollywood.",127 out of 752 found this helpful.
" Flying High
",DarkVulcan29,27 May 2022,10,"Top Gun (1986) made Tom Cruise a star, and now 36 years later he jumps back in role of Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick almost like he never left.Maverick never seems let his age slow him down, and still is cocky has ever, and is ordered to train a bunch of young pilots for a deadly mission, but sees a little bit of himself in them, and must get them working together has a team.Tom Cruise is great has Maverick, who is coming to terms with the past. Miles Teller and Glen Powell are also great, and not to mention Jennifer Connelly. But the flying scenes are what makes this movie, you feel like your flying with them. Feels has real has ever. A terrific sequel 36 years worth the wait.

" What an excellent sequel
",r96sk,25 May 2022,9,"What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.'Top Gun: Maverick' is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence.Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.",513 out of 648 found this helpful.
" TOM CRUISE YOU LEGEND!
",nihal-38544,25 May 2022,9,"This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience. Not some cropped cgi scenes.

" Paid for the whole seat, but only used the edge
",pucciarello,28 May 2022,9,"I'll preface my review by first stating that I had mediocre expectations coming in. It's very hard to make a successful sequel to an older classic movie, but I was immediately entertained from beginning to end. I won't give any spoilers, but I'll list my biggest takeaways from the movie.1. The flying scenes were incredible and had me on the edge of my seat.2. Tom cruise and miles teller were awesome.3. I want to quit my job and become a fighter pilot now.This movie is definitely worth paying for imax tickets and I suggest you get a big water bottle cause you will be sweating profusely as Maverick cuts through the sky like butter.

" Tom Cruise really knows how a blockbuster film is made.
",cruise01,29 May 2022,10,5 out of 5 stars.Top Gun Maverick is an awesome action film that lives up to the original film and way superior as well. It is one awesome thrill ride that will have the audiences gasping for air with its exhilarating aerial combat scenes.The plot is great. It continues with Maverick (Tom Cruise) being assigned to train new pilots before they go off on a challenging mission. Rooster (Miles Teller) is among the recruits which Maverick tries to reconnect after the incident with his father in the previous film.The plot tries to build an emotional powerhouse as Maverick are neck to neck about the past. And Maverick trying to get these pilots prepared for there first combat.The script is great and fast moving. Director Joseph Kosinski nails making a blockbuster film. Making the action sequences cinematic. And big and loud. Majority of the action scenes are practical and realistic which makes it better. The climatic sequence with the pilots on the mission was awesome and thrilling. Definitely worth seeing this film on the biggest screen with great sound quality.The cast ensemble is great. Tom Cruise nails making a big action film. Cant wait to see what he does with his next films. Miles Teller also was good. Jennifer Connelly playing Mavericks past love interest. The new additions were all great as well. The music score was awesome.The opening sequence gives you the chills with its similiarities to the first.Top Gun Maverick is one of the best films this year. Amazing action sequences that is cinematic and big. And big film that deserves to be seen in theatres.,324 out of 426 found this helpful.
" Talk to me Goose
",kosmasp,30 May 2022,10,"It makes more than sense to have seen the first Maverick movie. I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.There are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don't hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing ""back"" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.Now is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you'd find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.Those things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don't give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you've got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.There is also technical talk that I didn't totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.First time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn't know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn't have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas). Even being able to predict story points will not take away anything from the experience you can have with this. Enjoy.",312 out of 425 found this helpful.
" we get what we hoped for
",ferguson-6,24 May 2022,8,"Greetings again from the darkness. Heavy on melodrama. Heavy on cockiness. Heavy on fighter jets. Heavy on nostalgia. Check. Everything that we want and expect in the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 film is present. It's a movie spectacle featuring one of the few remaining bonafide movie stars front and center, as well as breathtaking action sequences that beg to be experienced on the largest screen possible and with the highest quality audio available. Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr are credited for the characters, while the new screenplay involved collaboration from Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, Christopher McQuarrie, Peter Craig, and Justin Marks. The original film's director, Tony Scott, passed away in 2012 at age 68, and Joseph Kosinski (OBLIVION, 2013, also starring Tom Cruise) takes the helm.Callbacks to the original are plentiful, and we get our first in the opening title card - the same one used in 1986 to explain the ""Top Gun"" training center. Of course, there is one reason we are here, and that's Tom Cruise. He was only 24 years old in the original, and now lives and exudes the swagger of Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell. When the film opens, Maverick is an extreme test pilot pushing himself and an experimental aircraft to Mach 10, and yes, this goes against the wishes and order of the program's Rear Admiral in charge played by a curmudgeonly Ed Harris. It's a shame that Harris only has a couple of brief scenes, but he is the one that informs Maverick of his new orders to return to Top Gun immediately. His new commanding officer is Beau ""Cyclone"" Simpson (Jon Hamm), who is none too happy about Maverick being back. However, the order came directly from Maverick's old nemesis/friend, Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), now a highly decorated Admiral in failing health.Maverick is disappointed to learn that he has been brought in, not to fly, but to teach a group of Top Gun graduates how to execute an extraordinarily dangerous mission involving extended high speeds at a low altitude, dropping bombs on the uranium enhancement plant protected by a mountain range, and then immediately elevating to a nearly impossible level to avoid a crash - all while being targeted by the enemies radar and defense system. The enemy goes unnamed so that the movie can remain timeless and avoid any type of political backlash. Plus, this film is about thrills and action, not a political statement.Being back means Maverick crosses paths with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), who was mentioned briefly in the first film as an Admiral's daughter. She now owns the local bar, has a daughter, races sailboats, and still carries a bit of a torch for Maverick, although she's quick to bust his chops whenever possible. However, it's the pilots he's charged with training that cause the biggest issue for Maverick. One of them is Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw. Rooster is the son of ""Goose"" (played in the original by Anthony Edwards), who flew with Maverick as his Radio Intercept Officer (RIO) and died in an ejection mishap. Rooster holds Maverick responsible and Maverick is still haunted by his friend's death. Goose is seen in photos and via flashbacks, and Rooster emulates his dad at the bar's piano. The conflict between Rooster and Maverick adds complications to the mission - and a bit of melodrama to the entire film.The newbies (and the Navy) consider Maverick a relic of a bygone era, so of course, 'instructor' Maverick takes to the sky to strut his pilot stuff. In addition to Rooster, the standouts in the new group include Phoenix (Monica Barbaro), Bob (Lewis Pullman), and Hangman (Glen Powell), the latter of whom, along with Rooster, tries to recreate that symbiotic relationship we originally saw with Iceman vs Maverick. Teller and Powell are both solid, but this aspect never really clicks like the Rooster vs Maverick piece.We can't help but notice that the dramatic elements seem to be more of a focus this time around. The biggest impact comes from the scene where Mavericks visits Admiral Kazansky (Iceman) at his home. Despite his well-known physical limitations, Val Kilmer delivers a memorable performance, and the two actors seem to relish this opportunity. The situation is handled with grace, and we are appreciative of Cruise standing firm in his demand for Kilmer to appear in the film. As for the love story between Penny and Maverick, it had to be a bit frustrating for Ms. Connelly to work so hard on an underwritten role, while Jon Hamm's constant furrowed brow and barking leaves him coming across as little more than jealous of Maverick.Obviously it's the fighter jets and aerial sequences that folks will come for, and spectacular and exhilarating are the best words I can find to describe what we see. I was fortunate to see his in IMAX, and if you have one near you, it's certainly the preferred viewing format. Thanks to the Navy and the training and equipment received by the cast, there is an authentic feel that's almost throwback in this day and age of CGI. We sense the speed and gravity pulls, even if we are never in peril. The aircraft carrier sequences are mind-boggling, though it's jets in the air that provide the energy jolt.Wise-cracking and heartstring-tugging moments fill the screen, and you can relax knowing Kenny Loggins' ""Danger Zone"" is back, while Berlin is thankfully not. Sand volleyball has been replaced by some semblance of shirtless and sweaty beach football as a team-builder, and yes, we get the patented Tom Cruise sprints - three times: on a treadmill, during beach football, and in a forest. The familiar sounds of Harold Faltermeyer's original score are back, this time enhanced by Hans Zimmer and an ending song by Lady Gaga. Those from the original who are absent this time are the great Tom Skerritt, James Tolkan, Kelly McGillis, and Meg Ryan (whose character is mentioned as having passed away). Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is back, though his partner on the original, Don Simpson, died in 1996 at age 52. Deserving of kudos are cinematographer Claudio Miranda, film editor Eddie Hamilton, and those involved with sound, visual effects, and music. For those feeling the need for speed, this sequel delivers; just embrace the cliches and familiarity, and predictability.Only in theaters (as it should be) Friday May 27, 2022.",275 out of 384 found this helpful.
" Misses the Mark Completely
",JayhawkJuJu,27 May 2022,1,"The first movie was pretty terrible but I absolutely loved it. And when Goose died, I cried. I still cry at that scene.As for the sequel? I felt nothing. Absolutely nothing. First you get to sit through Tom Cruise's hokey ""commercial"" at the beginning saying he did this for the fans. Was this to rehab his image? He's so creepy.I'm not sure what the problem was with Top Gun: Maverick. Lots of talky drama and Military politics. Blech. You have Jon Hamm playing a meanie admiral bureaucrat the same way he played Don Draper. Hamm shows a serious lack of acting range. The 2nd generation fighter pilots checked all the boxes as expected: the latina, the black guy, the nerd, the arrogant jerk. A few more thrown in for good measure.The first top gun was fresh and new. Perhaps the writers/directors/producers underestimated what needed to be done to make the sequel work? Their audience has since seen 35 years of schlock and formulaic and PC screenplays. What seemed novel in 1986 looks like laziness and boredom and stupidity in 2022.The only stand outs were two ladies. Jennifer Connelly as the Bond girl (I mean, Maverick's girl)...stood out by a mile. I've never understood why she hasn't been in more movies. And Jean Louisa Kelly makes a cameo as Iceman's wife. Both exuded warmth and depth. JLK was on the screen for maybe 3 minutes and she made more impact than any of the fighter pilots who monopolized all the other scenes. (ironically she stole the show in Mr Holland's Opus too. She's been doing it her whole career)Miles Teller isn't a bad actor, but in this movie, he's not likeable. At all. I didn't care about him at all. Goose was the heart and soul of the first movie. His son? The opposite. When you try to center a whole movie around an entitled, cranky, chip-on-his-shoulder son, you have Top Gun: Maverick.The only rewarding part was when Maverick humiliates the baby fighter pilots who think they have nothing to learn. He smashes their GenZ arrogance into a zillion pieces and it was glorious.",92 out of 382 found this helpful.

" This Topped and Outgunned the Original
",thesar-2,29 May 2022,9,"See? This is why I LOVE Tom Cruise Post-Mid-1992. Aside from the RARE misfire, cough, cough, The Mummy, when Tom Cruise wants a movie to be better than perfect, he pushes it past Mach 10.The first half of this adventure made me feel this is the perfect and worthy sequel to the original. AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that's lightning that can't be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.Maverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the ""Top Gun"" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there's a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.What matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it's WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.While the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn't all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they're learning to be the best. And they may someday.The movie's music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.If you loved the first one, there's virtually no way you wouldn't love this even more. It's absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it's also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.And to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.I can't recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don't wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don't miss out like I did with the original in 1986.***Final Thoughts: I *just* made my Top Ten Tom Cruise movie list, time to update it:1.

" A CONTENDER FOR MOVIE OF THE YEAR. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE! 🎥🍿🛫
",DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,25 May 2022,10,"Just Saw This In IMAX and guys what an experience it was.Components of this Movie-1. Firstly what a cast! EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER seemed like they were having a Great Time Acting in this movie. INCLUDING the serious minded Admirals. Great Performances all around.2. Every Scene flows so well. The time flew by.3. Many of the Jokes Landed Strongly throughout the Movie with the audience I was with. Especially the ""You Told Me Not to Think"" Scene. 😂🤣4. The Visuals of the Fighter Jet Scenes were Astonishing. They looked so good.5. The Story was good enough, on top of that, the suspense was built up throughout towards the Actual Mission. With The Training Missions and Different Conundrums the Team Faced.Overall, What A Movie and Going Further, What an Experience it was.",251 out of 359 found this helpful.

The plot is simple; the bad Iranians dare to build an uranium enriching plant, and the good American Air Force (we have the best fighter pilots in the world) destroying the plant.The movie itself had the usual cheesy side story of hero meets old flame and falls in love again.This were 2,5h of utter boredom.

" An Unpopular Opinion: Overrated, Overhyped and Aimless
",zac-04879,15 June 2022,5,"The new, acclaimed and horribly popular Top Gun sequel is just the same boring blockbuster with the latest special effects to appeal to the standards these days. The cinemas will be absolutely packed and the movie will keep striking hits at the box office, but it's just Tom Cruise returning for another 2-hour round of exciting dogfights, poor story and bad pacing.There is absolutely nothing special about Top Gun: Maverick; it's just a pointless waste of time, especially considering its 1986 predecessor was more even more decent than this movie is. It'll definitely offer big audiences who lived through the 80s with their powerful levels of nostalgia, just like Scream fans would've received a nice touch from the new Scream, which is perfectly reasonable.This film actually lives with some pretty good direction, admirable cinematography, emotional connections and tamer content, but that doesn't overlap how it turned out. In fact, those are the only perks throughout this movie. The story is overlong and very boring to watch, just after being predictable and filled with attempted elements that just don't work out. Tom Cruise and the entire cast is tiring to watch and the writing is terrible.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",193 out of 338 found this helpful.
" For the braindead
",alexpkimel,10 June 2022,1,"Shallow romance, shallow character work, extremely predictable, how did Tom Cruise even survive at the start, literally no stakes, mission is extremely vague, no one who worked on the film clearly has no understanding of planes and this is coming from an actual pilot. I hate this movie and everyone who liked it.

" The most feel-good action movie in recent times.
",Prashast_Singh,28 May 2022,10,"Having loved Top Gun, I clearly wasn't going to miss Top Gun: Maverick, and also being a fan of Tom Cruise, I knew the best place to watch it would be the big screen. I totally enjoyed the film as I watched it with a helping of popcorn. There were moments where I felt excited, emotional and even laughed along with the other viewers. It delivers light, simple and sweet entertainment in a delicious mix of action, drama, some romance and humor in a delightful manner.Tom Cruise shines in his performance where he is required to display a good range of emotions and has a good chemistry with Jennifer Connelly, while also impressing us in the action sequences as he always does. Speak of which, the action is very beautifully executed as well as filmed. Every time the jets turned, I felt like my head moved along in the same direction. This effect is repeated multiple times and ends up immersing the viewer into the thrill of the action. It's very clean and neatly done, and never violent at all. The film has no adult content, due to which you can watch it with your families.The music and score are terrific, and the cinematography is another major plus. Some might find the initial few acts a little slow, but the action sequences completely steal the show, especially in the lengthy and spellbinding final act. The editing is top notch, as the film never feels long or stretched. I was actually surprised how short it felt, and in a good way. Top Gun: Maverick is a very feel-good action movie with realistic action and emotions to deliver an experience of a lifetime. If you enjoyed Top Gun, chances are you will find yourself loving this film even more, for Cruise once again proves he's the man to look for when quality action is what viewers crave. Must watch on the big screen. Period.",237 out of 326 found this helpful.
" I just witnessed history
",MatthewMichaelHoffman,25 May 2022,10,"SCORE: 10/10I actually feel speechless. That was one of the most amazing things I have seen in my life and I got to see it 3 days early in XD. Wow. I feel like that changed the way movies will be made forever. It was the perfect blend of old and new, with absolutely incredible audio and visuals and some of the best storytelling I've ever seen in a movie. I just witnessed history.There were multiple points in which the movie could've ended and I would've been satisfied, but it just kept getting better and better and better. Maverick saves Rooster and then Rooster saves Maverick and then they team up to escape just for Hangman to come save them. I was on the edge of my seat, emotionally invested, and inspired by the performances of all involved. But, Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, and Glen Powell stole the show.Could they have picked a better Rooster? Miles Teller was a spitting image of Goose and gave the performance of a lifetime. You could feel his pain and you could feel his struggle and how much everything meant to him. It was paired perfectly with Hangman's character, who was executed without flaw. That's what this movie was to me. Flawless.But this last part is for Tom Cruise. You can't tell me that man is almost 60. I won't believe you. His energy and charisma is what truly carried this film to a place in movie history. Hitting Mach 10, continuing to go after he hit Mach 10, going through the course in 2 minutes and 15 seconds. No matter what was thrown his way, he found a way to exceed expectations and teach everyone lessons along the way. His scene with Val Kilmer was so special. ""It's time to let go"". His struggle with how to handle Rooster being explained that his mother's dying wish was for him to convince Rooster not to take after his dad was powerful. I laughed at the many moments of perfectly timed humor, I was sucked in during the moments of breath-taking action, and I cried during every emotional moment this film had to offer.",221 out of 325 found this helpful.
" More corn than the Jolly Green Giant
",radhrh,13 June 2022,6,"I drove an hour each way to see this in a movie theater, my first visit to one a couple of years because I wanted to get the full cinematic experience. What I got was a huge pile of corn. If not for the flying sequences, which are awesome, the rest of the movie is a bit pants. Ed Harris is in it for a single scene, more of a cameo role than anything. Val Kilmer's scene was embarrassing. Jennifer Connelly is looking her age and plays a half baked love interest which frankly the film could have done without. Is she supposed to be the Kelly McGillis role from the original movie? She lives in a very similar house and she drives a Porsche so who knows? The plot revolves around a mission so uniquely unlikely that it makes the movie slightly preposterous. The cast of pilots don't hold a candle to the original cast and their characters are two dimensional and boring. It isn't Tom Cruise's best performance either playing the eponymous Maverick, a man still plagued by the death of his buddy, Goose from the first movie. Come on, man. That was 35 years ago, get over it FFS! Jon Hamm, who I normally like doesn't look comfortable playing Maverick's up tight commander and there's a scene of beach football which is supposed to mirror the volleyball scene from the first movie but just looks gay AF. Once again the flying scenes are unbelievable, by that I mean extremely believable. The actors must have actually been in the planes for at least some of the shots and CGI has been kept to a minimum which is great to see. But take away those sequences, which don't account for much run time, maybe 15% of total run time, and what you have left is quite poor.",191 out of 320 found this helpful.

" More Hollywood Banality
",XE_Kilroy,11 June 2022,1,"That a Top Gun 2 happened twenty years later highlights that it was never a necessity in the first place. There's nothing new or worthwhile to the venture, and cheapened by weaving in political sub-plots to today's world. The Top Gun 'universe' is not better now than before.It just emphasizes the continuing ways that Hollywood is struggling from a creativity and production standpoint. The big time lone producers with guts and vision replaced by a conglomeration of financial backers and boardroom analytics who don't value the daring and creative scriptwriters and ideas people. Opting instead for employees who'll follow instructions. Or something like that.We had the era of remaking old TV shows into movies. Now it seems we're on the cusp of a new era. We already kind of saw this happen with Matrix Resurrections, now Top Gun got the treatment. Flicking back thru old hit movies with the idea of bringing actors back for the sake of nostalgia. What next? Point Break 2, Con Air 2, Pretty Woman 2, etc..I can already see it.This incites me to bring up another annoyance of mine. Sequels in general...There are certain movies pre-planned to be trilogies, like Harry Potter, which are fine. Or adaptions of a 5+ book series that need sequels.But a lot of the time it's a standalone movie that does well, that they milk to death which ruins it. Often it's from part 3 onwards that the rot sets in. It's easier to find a story in a part 2, something in the original script, a loose end, a what if, that offers a continuation. Part 2 often closes it. So when they then try to make up a story for part 3 it's often a reach, or rehashing the original due to a lack of creativity and the studio pushing something thru shoddily for a quick buck.So many movie franchises.... The Matrix, Alien, Terminator, Die Hard, Rocky, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Final Destination, Star Wars, Dirty Harry, Lethal Weapon, etc....the list goes on and on. There are some ok ones at part 3 or beyond, but they're not common. I know it's probably film heresy what I'm saying, but the world would've survived with just an original or a part 2.I understand the motivations behind some of them -- creating franchises, universes, that can become financial juggernauts across other media too. But the vast majority of them end up falling into silliness and mediocrity, ruining the lore/canon of the original in trying to pad story in.Most fans of particular franchises are happy to keep diving into ongoing sequels. It's all just entertainment, not end of the world stuff. Still, that's my unpopular opinion.The world would've survived and been none the worse if there was only one Top Gun.",113 out of 288 found this helpful.
" The end of cinema
",bzahariev,30 May 2022,1,"Maverick murdered cinema. For a movie that boasts ultrasonic speed, this death was slow and painful. Top Gun:Maverick the biggest disgrace of a movie I have ever watched. My brain ached halfway through, the amount of sodding cliches that this is built on is devastating, please don't do this to yourselves.This is not even close to a blockbuster, not even a pathetic remake. It is shallow, bland, tasteless, utterly devoid of any meaningful plot development. I will not even begin to describe the flippant implications it leaves about contemporary American power.It does not even do it justice to say this movie is Tom Cruise enjoying himself all the time? Yet, why Tom, why? What is there to smile about so much in all these inappropriate places? And I have always liked Tom Cruise. But it seems the whole point of the movie was to prove some middle-age-crisis induced point that Tom Cruise, being Tom Cruise, can pilot a jet.The problem is, if you do this to yourselves, you will never be able to see the original Top Gun with the same innocent, unspoiled eyes again.",69 out of 282 found this helpful.

" BEST FILMS OF THE YEAR SO FAR!!!
",HabibieHakim123,25 May 2022,10,"Basically my only problem with the first Top Gun is the relationship between Maverick and Charlie, the love story, i'm fine with them at first but later on i don't care anymore, that's it, the rest of the first Top Gun was badass, it was great and it was fascinating, Top Gun: Maverick, a long wait sequel, my first problem with this movie is nothing, zero, and yes there is still a love story in this one but i like it, it did not bother me at all, i'm fine with it, is it necessary? No, but Jennifer Connelly performance is convincing enough, the rest of Top Gun: Maverick is a visually well done film, the movie succeed to make me feel so intense and it's really probably the most intense feeling i got in a non-horror movie, the movie is also surprisingly emotionally moving, Maverick is never been a guy that i was that adored, and as a character a fanatic, but somehow someway i feel like i was know him longer than ever, i feel closer to him more than ever, and i was care to him way more than ever, all the new Top Gun team is as exciting as the previous one and probably even more, Miles Teller is really the second best performance in here next to Tom Cruise, a very very powerful performances by Miles Teller, the music like the first one was great, the score, and of course the whole plane sequence was just terrific, overall Top Gun: Maverick is one of those movie that you have to watch in the theaters not only because it's a great movie but the sound and the visual is a big screen only experience, it's a way better movie than the first one too, i loved every second of this movie, it is truly a very emotional ride, it's a very fun ride, it's a very intense ride, and at in the end the whole movie is a fantastic ride, Top Gun: Maverick is so far for me the best films of the year.",172 out of 263 found this helpful.

" The epitome of American military forces pathos, but highly entertaining at the same time
",Horst_In_Translation,30 May 2022,6,"""Top Gun: Maverick"" is an American, no THE American, movie from 2022 and this one runs for minimally over two hours if we don't count closing credits as you can add another ten minutes for those. The director is Joseph Kosinski and this is not the first time he has worked with lead actor Tom Cruise, but we will get a little later to cast and characters. In any case, Kosinski is not new to filmmaking, but also not extremely experienced. He has worked on a few films that also include American hero characters since his breakthrough in 2010, so him being picked for this one kinda makes sense. The key writer is Peter Craig. He is maybe the bigger name with his involvement with the Hunger Games franchise, the newest Batman movie and also The Town, maybe the best he has come up with so far. In any case, the parallel between him and Kosinski is that they both had their big breakthrough ten years into the new millennium. There are two other writers credited and these come from the original Top Gun movie from 35 years ago approximately. You can check their names if you like. One of them is still alive and I wonder what he thinks about the quality of this new film and if the high praise it has received so far is justified. Director Tony Scott died about a decade ago and you can read his name also at the end of the film. A few more words on the crew you could say here, namely on the music department: The names Harold Faltermeyer, Hans Zimmer and Lady Gaga in the same movie sure make for something unique. I must say I am not a Gaga fan though and her song towards the end also did almost nothing for me. We will see if she can score another Oscar nomination with it. I hope not. So yeah, for me as a German, there is surely more focus on the two Germans I have just mentioned. Now, let's look at the cast: It really from beginning to end all about Tom Cruise. Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly plays the love interest. Miles Teller (Whiplash) plays the protagonist's former wingman's son. Mad Men's Jon Hamm plays the closest to an antagonist. Val Kilmer is I think the only one (except Cruise of course) who reprises his role from the old film and he looks a lot like Jon Voight here. No Meg Ryan. There's others. Of course here you can also check out the list yourself if you care.As for the film, I am not sure I have ever seen more American pathos in one movie. The consequence was unfortunately that pretty much every single character felt fairly stereotypical. And yet, somehow it all went right. I would not agree with the raving reviews or extremely high average ratings, but I was genuinely entertained here from beginning to end. I mean I am probably biased because I like most of the cast members. Huge fan of Cruise, his personal life is none of my business. Miles Teller is one of the younger actors I really like and Jon Hamm is always a joy to watch. Simply love Mad Men. But also the ones playing smaller characters are totally fine. Glen Powell is the best example. He seemed so familiar, but maybe it is just the face. I could not really say where I saw him before. There was also the possibility his character could end up as an antagonist, but eventually the opposite is the case. Maybe the coolest moment of the film when he shows up to save the two more central male characters and what he says there. And it fits. It is all about how people in the military stick together and they are really one team, one unit, so they could not have one of them become a true antagonist or so. If you can maybe criticize the characters, then it refers to the female characters. Not a great deal of depth to them. This applies to Connolly's role for sure, but maybe also to Monica Barbaro's character, even if she is super easy on the eyes. Then again, she is just one of the military characters that do not get a lot of screen time and even less elaboration. Despite making the cut. Most of the time, she is just there to admire Cruise's character. Admittedly, to move a bit away from the gender talk, you can also say that Bob does not have too much screen time either. He just creates laughs when he is introduced with his military (non-)nickname. Just like some others when they initially do not know yet who it is they are carrying out of the bar. Next day, the rude awakening happens. Oh yeah, Barbaro's character also had that moment when Hangman is criticized for being anti-female, another reference where you could think he is maybe a bad guy, but he is just cocky and that's it and also some of the others do not like him as much as Teller's character for sure. They want the latter to be their team leader.I do agree with those saying that perhaps the last half hour is the highlight here. They kept the mission pretty simple. Early on, it still seems almost like a casting show, but this is not what it gets to be about. Eventually, the focus is on the mission itself: What they have to do exactly, namely hit two precision shots from up above to destroy radioactive substance belonging to the enemy. At the same time, they do not only have to make the shots, but also be very quick and get out safely afterwards. This is emphasized especially on one occasion when Cruise's character (the film is fittingly named after him) talks to Hamm's. Oh and by the way, the enemy is not explicitly stated. They are called a rogue state or rogue nation and that is it. We do not see the bad guys' faces either. The one thing we do know is that it is rather cold in said country. Honi soit qui mal y pense. If you know what I mean with politic events in 2022. Okay, the film was made before that and let's not get into detail on this now. Focus on the film instead. What we must get into detail on is how gimmicky this film felt at times and how it was almost too much and sometimes crossing the fine line between being entertaining and being simply over-the-top. This applies to almost everything involving Connelly's character. How we literally see her fall for him. How her daughter tells Cruise's character not to hurt her again. That was maybe the funniest moment from the film when she sees him there jumping from her mother's window. The words he tells Connelly's character one one occasion were also fairly gooey.There are more scenes that did feel on the awkward side. I mean I like Cruise, but people who don't could really struggle here. Also when Hamm looks at him in the end and finally accepts his greatness. How Kilmer's character dies on one occasion. How Maverick at the beach makes sure the gang becomes a team and shows us his great topless body as well and that he is easily in strong enough shape to take on these youngsters. Like he did before during the training. There are so many other moments. Of course, I must mention the scene in which Cruises's character pretty much loses his job and then shows everybody what he is capable of and that it is possible to get this mission done. In the process, he steals a priceless plane as well. Hamm's character's words there, his reaction was also so entertaining to watch, even if a bit exaggerated, but he made the most of it. The actor I mean. And was there ever any doubt that Cruise's character would fly the mission himself and not just be a teacher? Probably not. I mean I had some doubt if he would make it out alive in the end. Everybody knew the mission would be a success and also that Teller's character would live, but you could always think Cruise's Maverick would die a hero here. Eventually, he did not. It happened in another big franchise recently and that was enough, so good that they let the guy at the center live this time.I must also totally mention the flight sequences. They are nothing short of spectacular and the heart and soul of the film. Of course, the landscapes with all the snow are a true highlight towards the end, but also what they called the dogfight in the end with the evil pilot guy was a true highlight. This they had to use to really show that it is all about the pilot when it comes down to man versus man and not about the (potentially inferior) plane. Also pay attention to the recurring idea of ""Don't think. Just do."" This was also quite on the edge between cool and too much. But it's all good I'd say. Just like when Mach 10 extremely early on wasn't enough yet for Maverick. But I take it with the ""Where am I?"" ""Earth."" quote. That was hilarious. Maverick surely survives really many of these critical situations up in the air with his plane coming down fast. The drama coming from flocking birds or characters losing consciousness because an elephant is metaphorically sitting on their chest was nice entertainment too for sure. Surely, a lot more I could mention. Oh yes, Ed Harris in the prologue. How could I forget about him!? I also think they established some nice ties to the original movie. Good job there. I suggest watching that one right before you see this one here. But it is not a must-do of course. You will nicely understand the story in here as well without even having heard of the film from the 80s. Not a requirement to know or have seen that one. So yeah, I give ""Top Gun: Maverick"" surely a thumbs-up and to be honest I almost felt myself at some point as if I was sitting in a flight simulator because the cockpit scenes were so convincing. By the way, could one say anything negative about this film when Cruise himself shows up at the world premiere in a helicopted he flew himself? Doubtful. Coolest guy ever. And right man for the role. Do not miss out on this quality film before it disappears from movie theaters. At home, it will not be half as spectacular, even if admittedly you can play a little drinking game with your friends where one has to take a shot for each cringeworthy moment and you will be pretty drunk when it's over. Not gonna lie. With this film, you get what you came for.",52 out of 254 found this helpful.
" Are these reviews being bought by the military industrial complex?
",SwissCheeze,23 July 2022,1,"Went with an open mind. Didn't expect anything from the movie. Hadn't even seen a trailer until the reviews were claiming it was a masterpiece, so I decided to check it out. Predictable plot, no stakes, CHEESIEST dialogue you ever heard, piss poor character development, boring plot, etc. This movie is such a waste of time. Was rolling my eyes at Tom Cruise's cheesiness. And Jennifer Connelly's character was so embarrassingly cringe. Also why was the edgy Air Force guy smiling throughout every single line of his. Again, the best way I'd describe this movie is cheesy. What a ridiculous movie.

" Holy cow such a great IMAX experience!
",UniqueParticle,31 May 2022,10,"Tom Cruise is still an ultimate being at 59 years old it's outstanding! Top Gun: Maverick deserves so much for how practical everything is. Great the IMDb rating is 8.7 hope it stays high, should even get awards. The music hit the spot, cinematography is beautiful, the story flow well, and the acting is incredible so much so that even though Val Kilmer has mouth cancer in real life he has a small part in the film. I like how the main characters trained for a near impossible mission that all was built up quite well.

" Paper thin plot and nothing to love.
",edward-a-bowden,29 May 2022,2,"Let's get this straight. Very few people are bigger fans of the original top gun than me, and I've waited decades for this sequel.But it is truly awful, which has really upset me.The plot is paper thin, with the mission ripped shamelessly from Star Wars.There is no explanation about the scramjet programme that Maverick was piloting before he presumably crashed it.There are no characters to love and no characters to hate.There is no explanation for Penny Benjamin being the love of Maverick's life, given all we know about her previously was one 'ballistic' incident in the 80s.There is precisely zero chemistry between Maverick and Benjamin.There is precisely no sense of camaraderie between the 'best of the best' that Maverick has to coach for the 'suicide mission'. Nor is there any real sense of competition amongst them, unlike the original where they were vying for the top gun trophy.The topless football game in the sea is a very poor rip off of the topless volleyball in the original.There is no enemy. The main danger comes from surface to air missiles.And finally, the shark is well and truly jumped when they steal a 40-year old F14 that is magically charged and fuelled, then take off from a runway they destroyed half an hour into the movie.Seriously, I could go on but I won't.Two stars for the aerial photography and the skill of the actually pilots, but there is nothing else to recommend here.Perhaps this is what the original would have been without the genius script that was actually about one man's struggle with his sexuality with a few aerial battles thrown in, rather than just a movie about fighter pilots.",124 out of 238 found this helpful.

" Amazing entertainment
",851222,2 June 2022,10,"Greetings from Lithuania.I wasn't the biggest fan of first ""Top Gun"" movie. I saw it like 5 years ago so for me it wasn't nostalic or anything. It was just OK movie and nothing more.Today i saw ""Top Gun: Maverick"" (2022) in cinema. And it blew me away. This movie was incredible. It literally put a smile on my face. Action scenes in the air were the best i ever saw of this type of action. Directing by Joseph Kosinski was perfect. Music was on spot. Cinematography was gorgeous. I loved how actually calm and quite this movie was, until it wasn't and transition between scenes, acts, calm and action was perfect. Acting was great. This is a movie making as good as it gets. Was it predictable? Yes. But at the same time i was excited and glued to the screen during its whole 2 hours run time.Overall, ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is a Hollywood blockbuster done right. Its a Hollywood action adventure movie in every possible way, yet this time its done incredibly good. What a terrific sequel.",168 out of 233 found this helpful.
" Worth the wait
",sambitswain,23 May 2022,10,"Really!! It's amazing how something so good and looked forward to was above expectation. Amazing set designs, incredible character building, action sequences that are perfectly choreographed. This is one of the, if not, most ambitious films with a flawless execution. The fact that the director's vision is so blended with Tom Cruise and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Tom Cruise is a machine. He knows what audiences want and he delivers. Not sure how they can top this one (but I thought the same after watching him cling onto a plane).You won't find a better movie of this type in the theatre right now and for the fans out there who appreciate this material, it will provide a memorable experience. Go see it you wont regret it.Perfection doesn't deserve a remake. It deserves a re-watch.

" Puts a smile on your face!
",HalBanksy,31 May 2022,9,"What a rush. Lucky enough to watch this is on a Dolby screen - a thrilling cinema experience. Outstanding direction and editing. The genuine aerial stunts really put to shame the endless CGI tripe that is slopped into theatres every week. The action here feels viscerally REAL - something that has been sorely missed from recent blockbusters.The new cast are all perfect. It's obvious they are having the time of their lives - and that infectious joy was felt by the whole audience. Charming, funny, arrogant and heartful at all the right times. I hope we will see them reunited on screen (and much sooner than 36 years!) The nearly 60 year old Tom Cruise does not look out of place. The practical flying scenes really cannot be praised enough. It's an action masterclass, I can barely fathom the work and effort it took to capture such ambitious footage.The film is self-aware and knows exactly what the audience is there to see. Clearly a better script than the original (although lacking the iconic quotes.) Killing off Meg Ryan seemed a bit unnecessary, especially after they made the effort to bring back Val Kilmer for a quite jarring cameo. Honestly the references to the original were slightly overkill to begin with, but thankfully settled down once the plot got going.I thought the film had come to a very satisfying climax, then a happy surprise to realise the final act was only just beginning! You can't deny that Tom Cruise pulled it off - a real movie star, in a real blockbuster hit. Oscars for sound, cinematography and editing are surely locked down. Simply the best film of 2022.",166 out of 226 found this helpful.
" Top Gun 2 was so bad i walked out
",adamjalexander,9 June 2022,1,"As a Navy veteran I was kind of excited to see the sequel. Between the 20,000 extreme close-ups and extremely old people in uniform it was impossible for me to watch and I was in aviation in the military. I walked out halfway through because it brought me to tears. Not tears of joy tears of boredom. I most definitely would not recommend seeing this movie unless it is the apocalypse and there is nothing else to watch. I thought it was going to be awesome because everybody said it was the best movie ever. If you go and watch this I promise you you will be extremely disappointed.

" So Sorry but I've LOST THAT LOVING FEELING!
",paulelliott-02057,9 June 2022,1,"Growing up in the 70s and 80s obsessed by military aviation and dreaming of being a fighter pilot the original Top Gun was literally perfect.It immersed you in an extremely realistic world of the, then modern, naval aviator with aircraft carrier action that could have really happened the next day in the cold war.Having heard amazing reviews and picked up on the interesting plot including the son of Maverick's dead RIO Goose. I was initially carried away by the first half of the movie.But then it happened... my suspended disbelief was stretched to beyond breaking point by an utterly unbelievable plot line. The concept of the mission was utterly ludicrous and there was zero development of the 2D characters such as 'Hangman'! Even Ice had a redeeming side?!Most if the reviews by critics don't seem ti relate to tge same movie.Sorry, but I've lost that loving feeling!!!Gutted!",78 out of 212 found this helpful.
" Low effort cash grab sequel with a ton of plot holes
",thebricks,30 May 2022,4,"1. Still acts like San Diego is the same place it was in the eighties, which couldn't be further from the truth.2. Maverick is, career-wise and socially still in the same place he was in 1986, which is hard to believe.3. Despite having pictures all over Pacific Fleet's lobby and being a legend in Naval Aviation, today's young top aviators have no clue who Maverick is.4. Unnamed enemy nation has fifth-generation fighter jets but no nuclear weapons, which is simply impossible.5. SAM missiles are easily visible on mountains but while cruise missiles were sent to take the airfield out, none were sent to take out the SAMs, which would have made the mission a lot easier.6. Tiresome trope at the beginning where Tom Cruise crashes the experimental plane, ends up in a diner around the Southwest that looks like it time traveled from the seventies or eighties, from the restaurant to the clothes people wore. I traveled all around that area and no one dresses like that. They all dress like Americans do all over the country. Waitresses at diners also all wear polos and pants, they don't wear dresses from the eighties. Hollywood seems to still think flyover country hasn't changed since 40 years ago.7. Pretty sure fifth-generation fighters wouldn't have to engage in a dogfight at close range with an F/A-18.8. Perhaps the most ludicrous scene in the film, the Hind attack helicopter is searching for Maverick and chooses to fire at him instead of capturing him. That doesn't happen, not even in Ukraine. Pilots are valuable to use as bargaining chips. Even regular soldiers are as we've seen in the past couple decades. You would think an advisor would have told them that scene was dumb.9. Other than a brief mention at the beginning, the movie pretends drones don't exist, which is a missed opportunity. Along with the Ukraine War, it makes the film look dated.10. Too much nostalgia for the old film, from the soundtrack that was copy and pasted with no variation, the need to include Goose's son, which was unnecessary, including Ice as a Commander. Cruise also doesn't show his age. The film needed to go in its own direction, not act like it was set one year after the original Top Gun.11. The training for the bombing run wasn't realistic. They couldn't copy the canyon exactly. Much of what Maverick did is likely already being taught to top aviators or easily accomplished by tech. If you know a lot about military equipment, or more than your casual viewer, the film is kind of silly.Top Gun was alright, but a sequel just wasn't warranted and was guaranteed to be off. It's a decent watch once, but look for this to be quickly forgotten like that Independence Day sequel. The high praise and reviews are kind of unwarranted.",100 out of 209 found this helpful.

" One of the best sequels ever
",masonsaul,28 May 2022,10,"Top Gun: Maverick accomplishes a very rare feat of being a long gestating sequel that is not only worthy of the original but actually better than it. Managing to retain the spirit of the original whilst also adding stronger stakes, a more emotionally involving narrative and better written characters.Tom Cruise is perfect as Maverick, bringing all the charm and star power but also adding much needed dramatic weight and sorrow to the character. He also has great chemistry with Jennifer Connelly, who is a strong love interest with lots of warmth and humanity.All of the new cast fit in perfectly and are all really memorable but Miles Teller is definitely the standout with a satisfying character arc and has equally great chemistry with Cruise. Val Kilmer's inclusion was a superb decision and is handled with immense love and respect.Joseph Kosinski's direction is absolutely amazing. The film looks amazing overall with some nice homages to Tony Scott's iconic style but the standout is definitely the flight sequences which are truly astonishing and satisfyingly practical.Sifting through hours upon hours of footage, the flight sequences are edited together in spectacular fashion, extremely comprehensible and never boring. The film itself has excellent pacing, naturally building to a thrilling climax that just keeps escalating.The soundtrack and music by Harold Faltermeyer, Lady Gaga and Hans Zimmer is also perfect. All the classics you expect are present and used in satisfying ways and the new music is appropriately epic. The new songs by Lada Gaga and One Republic are so good, utilised at the right moments and equally catchy and memorable.",118 out of 180 found this helpful.

",aubina,29 May 2022,1,".... same story line different characters, it's all predictable ... I think there isn't much creativity here, but the film rather relies on the theatrics and special effects of the real life US Navy pilots, who did an awesome job, in saving the movie. If you've seen the original you've seen the sequel. I believe much of the high ratings are a result of the ""bandwagon effect"" as well as the excellent marketing of the studios that made the movie. Sequels should never be made.

" A remake that actually worked
",jerrycoliver,30 May 2022,9,"So I can't give it 10 stars because ultimately it is a remake or sequel however you prefer to look at it. It falls into the same traps these films do with too many callbacks and rehashed scenes.That said, there is a very honest story about changing times and aging which ultimately drives the movie. Good cinema is subtle about real world situations (best example being Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. People not watching it when it was released probably would miss all the commentary on politics from the era.) So in that sense it's pretty bold and genuine.The flight sequences are...outstanding. It was mostly shot practically which is why is looks so much more impressive than other movies. Directing is good, not great (sans the action sequences, which are great.) Acting is great. Connelly, Cruise and Teller are all A-listers for a reason. So anyone who says ""there's nothing good about this movie"" are just haters. You can't by any stretch of criticism say the action sequences and acting aren't some of the best you'll see all year.It is very much a throwback to blockbusting movies from the 80's and it really feels like it. But we haven't had that in so long, it was nice to revisit it. I don't think it's one of the greatest movies of all times, but I gave it a 9 because it could be the greatest movie from the last 3-4 years. It didn't ask you to have watched a bunch of other movies to appreciate it (like Marvel) it wasn't preachy with its messaging, it didn't drag, it was humanizing but indulgent with drama. Just a perfect summer movie for the times.",113 out of 169 found this helpful.

" This is in my Top Five...
",art-miller,20 July 2022,1,"This is in my Top Five......worst films I have ever seen.Where do I begin...? This is teenage airhead nonsense. Made for video game enthusiasts who spend hours online playing shoot 'em up games. Endless explosions and huge noises battering you from every side at volume 11. Flashing lights and bursts of flame. Great if you're addicted to all that.The testosterone-charged macho gung ho male posturing in this film is archaic. Surely we have moved on from watching steroid pumped men puffing out their chests and shouting at each other to show who's got the biggest dick.And it is obvious from this pantomime start that all these rock hard jocks who hate each other will end up in saccharine male bonding by the end of the film. Hugging each other accompanied by insipid violin music. Oh, god.....it was nauseating...!I'm not going to rant about the ham acting throughout as that goes with the territory of American films like this. Tough guy college boys who have just discovered alcohol and girls for the first time, over excited and loud mouthed trying to establish their place in the chimpanzee pack.This film is so slow. We have to have a simpering love interest, of course, with lots of meaningful silent staring at each other. Feel the lurve, people... And more cheap, off-the-shelf orchestral whining to go with it. The whole 130 excruciating minutes stank of cheese...The plot... Almost forgotten until the end when we have all the noise and flames and empty CGI sprinklings that fail to add anything convincing to this tasteless mush.Ed Harris is wasted.

You only have to look at the 'movies' they churn out. But I am surprised that British audiences still fall for the hype that launches US films. This is a bad film on every level: script, acting, pace etc...I defy anyone over, say, twenty five to convince me otherwise. This is a kids' film.

" A sequel in auto-pilot
",apereztenessa-1,29 May 2022,1,"First things first. Top Gun Maverick is entertaining enough. If you're one of those people for whom that is all that matters in a movie, read no further.Beyond that, there are two ways to look at this film. The first and most obvious is that this is a replica of the original movie. Moviegoers and critics alike easily find themselves drawn to the game of comparing the original to the replica and seeking to assess if one is marginally better than the other, losing sight that the very issue is that one is drawn into that game. Inserting marginal differences into a movie is not what creativity, story-telling or great filmmaking are about. And while the film has been hailed as (yet another) savior of the big screen, ironically one of the most permanent feelings one experiences while watching it in the theatre is that you don't really need to be there.The second way to look at Top Gun Maverick is as a satire or criticism on American filmmaking today. The parallels between the original and this sequel are so strong that they become surreal, so extreme that one feels they must carry meaning. From the initial text explaining what Top Gun is (identical to the one from the original film) to the son of Goose singing Great Balls of Fire on the same piano of the same bar with the same mustache and the same shirt as his Dad thirty years ago, the scenes and the shots parallel the first movie to an extreme, almost reminiscent of Gus Van Sant's Psycho, or of the constant time-loop repetition in Edge of Tomorrow (McQuarrie is listed as screenwriter in in that film as well as in TG-M). The only difference with the original seems to be the planned mission, which is itself a reproduction of the Star Wars A New Hope final scene -one of the most famous action scenes ever-, as if to underscore that even a change introduced in an American film today can only be a reproduction of some other movie.The very first scenes of TG-M would support this theory. In those, we see Maverick testing a new stealth plane to have it reach Mach 10. The scene has the distinct feeling of the final scene of a movie, and the most memorable images in all of TG-M. It seems to hint at what this different story was that could have been told. Unfortunately, the plane test is interrupted by an Admiral who prefers drones to manned planes, a likely analogy to Hollywood executives who want movies made on auto-pilot.",55 out of 159 found this helpful.
" Where exactly were the military advisers to point out the obvious flaws?
",alleykirstie,26 May 2022,2,"Nostalgia is awesome and reliving fond memories is always a treat. But a return to 'Top Gun' is just laughable. Have you ever walked into someone house and noticed how everything is pointed at their television? Make the TV Tom Cruise and everything in the house the ""supporting cast"", and there you have this production. It's unemotionally sad. I don't expect quality from a Jerry Bruckheimer production, and God knows I've never heard of this director, but this was far below the nadir of my expectations. A little reminder, 'Top Gun' was a blockbuster back in its day, but it was never brilliant, edgy, nor even memorable as a good movie. It was a guilty pleasure for the revved up 1980's crowd of excess to feel proud about during the 4th of July. Needless to say, it was a huge action film for anyone chanting ""America"" at fireworks. The point of its longevity belongs to the gay subtext Quintin Tarantino famously describes. The bashing of how-bad-a-film it was is legendary and continues on several social media sites. Today's tech-savvy sophisticated audience will never believe (reading the 10 star reviews) that this is the ""greatest movie ever made"". The plot was absolute garbage. It's a script that is pieced together from catchphrases, old panning shots of military aircraft, recycled aerial footage from 'The Transformers', and most notably the 'Star Wars' trench run. Seriously, they took apart the original 'Top Gun' (sans the homoerotic subtext) and pretended it was something fresh for today's audience. We have Pete Mitchell as the oldest test pilot in history still going by the callsign Maverick after 30+ years. The unnamed enemy jets introduced in the last frames because real writers would put production over budget. It's just a gross mischaracterization of entertainment. Where exactly were the military advisers to point out the obvious flaws? In my opinion; this is a film with a lot of cash thrown at it to feed the vanity of someone who can't get enough of themselves. I need not play Devil's Advocate here and point out this film was made to ego-stroke a bad actor who wishes he could be Robert Redford.",43 out of 159 found this helpful.

" Great Flight Sequences, Cliche-Ridden Plot
",Stoshie,18 June 2022,7,"I don't share everyone's unbridled enthusiasm for this film. It is indeed a great popcorn flick, with outstanding aerial photography and maneuvers. But 10 stars? There are few, if any, movies that are perfect, and deserve that kind of rating.The problem with the film is the plot. It is so filled with age-worn cliches that one could easily tell what was coming from beginning to end. I mean, you had to know who was going to save the day at the end, and you had to know what was going to happen when Maverick jumped out of Penny's window. Those are just two examples of the many obvious plot points that you could see coming a mile away. I could list them all, but it would take up too much space here. Basically the entire plot was entirely predictable.The opening scene, especially, was straight out of Hollywood Screenplay Writing 101. I mean, seriously, how many times have we seen that subplot? Countless.There were no characters in the movie, either. They were all caricatures, stereotypes. No depth to any of them. They had their standard roles to play, and that was it.Did I enjoy the film? Sure, it was fun. Especially on a big theater screen with a loud sound system. Did I take anything away from the film? Did it make me think about anything after it was over? Nah. Will I see it again? Nah.I will give Tom Cruise credit for including Val Kilmer in the cast. Considering his health problems, that was a nice touch.So, yeah, enjoy the film. Sit back with your bag of popcorn and enjoy the g-forces. But don't pretend it is anything other than just another summer blockbuster.",110 out of 147 found this helpful.
" Nothing special
",squacakeit,26 June 2022,1,"It's basically a remake. I guess there is the nostalgia factor. I love flying. I was a commuter airline pilot for almost 20 years. I love all things Plane's/flying related. Pretty good action but nothing new. A few ridiculous parts that are unbelievable.

" Sequel Much Better than Original
",shelbythuylinh,26 May 2022,10,"Thirty-six years worth that of the wait. Tom Cruise returns to his star making role of Pete Maverick Mitchell that is now a Captain but he has not changed his way of doing things hint his nickname.Those over him like Ed Harris and Jon Hamm both not agreeing on a professional level what he does but seem to albeit reluctantly have a respect for him personally.He is reluctantly either given the choice to go back to the Top Gun school but as a teacher or face dishonorable discharge.Slowly yet surely he has earned the respect of the other pilots. Miles Teller as Rooster Bradshaw holding a grudge against Maverick over his late father, Goose Bradshaw's death in the original as the latter was his best friend.We see a very ill Val Kilmer in a two to three minutes as his former rival turned close friend Iceman now an admiral. It is very sad but very much worth remembering.Jennifer Connolly instead of Kelly McGinnis as the new love interest and single mother as the one that got away, the former not so much the latter.Maverick is more married to his job and that is why he never got married nor had kids.Great support also from breakout star Glen Powell as a pilot named Hangman who is cocky as he and Teller's Goose have a rivalry there.Movie is dedicated to the memory of the original director Tony Scott, who tragically died from suicide in 2012.",84 out of 145 found this helpful.
" What The Cinematic Experience Is All About
",zkonedog,30 May 2022,10,"In recent years, developments like cheap large-screen TVs, internet fast enough to support seamless streaming content, and work-from-home edicts/trends have rendered film largely a stay-at-home experience. There are certainly some pros to this: cheap snacks, on-demand viewing, and not having to venture out into the general public for mass-consumption of entertainment. But all that said, there is still something about the cinematic experience that captures the imagination--the big screen, the immersive sound, the live reactions/buzz, and the conversations afterward. Just the opportunity to ""get out"" might be underrated at this point. For all of us who enjoy such excursions and want more of them in the future, Top Gun: Maverick is the film we all needed.For a very basic overview, Maverick tells the story of the titular Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), still breaking in cutting-edge flying machines with no designs on sitting behind a desk. But in a world that has perhaps moved on from his ways, Maverick is sent back to Top Gun to help train a new class--including one Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), whose name may sound familiar to fans of the original 1986 effort--for a seemingly impossible mission. Along the way, he rekindles a relationship with an old flame (played by Jennifer Connelly) and comes to terms with some unfinished business--both emotionally and in the skies.First and foremost, TG: Maverick is a 10/10 film--and easily, at that--because it perfectly balances the ""new stuff"" with the legacy material. Five minutes in, I knew that Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski had the right formula. There is not a single wasted or boring moment here. Not only that, but the focus is squarely on Cruise's Maverick pretty much throughout (as the title might suggest). This isn't some cheap handoff to a ""new crew"" with Cruise shepherding the transition. This is a down-and-dirty, perfectly planned out melding of old and new.Cinematically, I can count on one hand (if that) the number of times I've been as enthralled from a theater seat. The phrase ""see it on the biggest screen possible"" might be bit trite, but in this case it couldn't ring more true (I saw it in IMAX format and was completely blown away!). The cinematography is one-of-a-kind, the sound reverberates through the entire theater, and the drama/laughs are palpable throughout. I can definitively state--beyond a shadow of a doubt--that seeing TGM in a theater is better than any home theater setup imaginable. It simply was created for the theater experience.A final movie-specific observation: the ability of this film to garner tears, laughs, and thrills in equal measure is nearly unparalleled. Everything it does--from re-introducing a legacy character hero, to the airborne theatrics, to the subtle or romantic character work--is crafted with incredible care and precision. There is something here for everyone (another cinema hallmark, come to think of it).It is easy--and sometimes popular--to write off Cruise's work due to some of his personal foibles. At this point, however, one does that at his/her own risk. Is he now the greatest cinematic star of all time? Unanswerable question, of course, but Top Gun: Maverick puts him in the conversation, to be sure. Without his dogged persistence in making sure this flick wasn't unceremoniously dumped onto a streaming platform, who knows what may have become of it (through all the delays and hand-wringing).Movies like this one definitively prove that the experience remains viable in the current entertainment environment (both for quality and money-making ability). The future of cinema is still murky, to be sure, but as Maverick himself intones about his supposedly impending extinction: ""Maybe so, sir...but not today"".",92 out of 142 found this helpful.
" exaggerated and overrated

exaggerated training: 10 best pilots can't do it after practicing, but you do it in the first try; I mean, did you ever play a game? A sport? A song? Anything with a tough achievement? It makes no sense.exaggerated timespan: enemy planes at 1 minute approaching supersonic, after several minutes of valley crawling + 2 ""impossible"" maneuvers, they are still at 30 seconds approaching.maneuvers and odds need no explanation.The movie is average, of course, but I give a 2 in an attempt to counterbalance the exaggerated acclaim from the old pops' feeling young again.",47 out of 142 found this helpful.
" Cruise remains a Top Gun
",Fluke_Skywalker,27 May 2022,7,"Hollywood had lost its way long before streaming services and a global pandemic nearly made going to the cinema obsolete. Content to strip mine the comic book genre and reboot/reimagine and regurgitate beloved franchises, it had become stale and tired. It's ironic then that a sequel to a nearly 40 year old film (You read that right. Scary isn't it?) might be the thing that points the way to their salvation.Top Gun: Maverick is a totally unnecessary film and on the surface it would seem to be Hollywood once again gnawing on a bone long since picked clean of any meat. The original Top Gun didn't exactly leave us with a bunch of unresolved issues or end on a cliffhanger. Just because a movie is good doesn't mean it needs a sequel. But here we are. And damn if they don't just manage to make it worthwhile, if still unnecessary.Top Gun: Maverick follows many of the same story beats as the original, but the tone here is far less... 80s. Fitting as it's not, well, the 80s. That doesn't mean it's some sort of post-modern deconstruction of the titualar character or a naval gazing treatise. It's got plenty of humor and, most important of all, it isn't saddled with preaching a ""woke"" message or poking us in the chest with some ideological finger. It's a movie that just wants to entertain, and entertain it does.Whatever you or I may think of Tom Cruise's ""religious"" beliefs, I dare anyone to say that there is an actor working today who brings the kind of passion and commitment to excellence to everything the way he does. He truly is the last real movie star, and I find myself appreciating him more and more with each passing year.My quibbles are just that. The romance between Cruise's Maverick and the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly's Penny is a tad perfunctory, even though they do share a nice chemistry and Connelly is particularly good. The enemy is also faceless and nameless, likely in an attempt to not offend any particular market; though to be fair this was also the case in the original.But these minor issues aside, Top Gun: Maverick is a refreshing throwback to a time when Summer films were fun, and after nearly 20 years of increasingly banal comic book, cgi shennanigans, it really hit the spot that much more.",86 out of 141 found this helpful.

Cast like one would cast a Lite Beer commercial.Had a crush on Kelly McGillis then, have a bigger crush on Jennifer Connelly now, but I didnt believe either of them had a thing with the Tom Cruise character.Look, the early reviewers are rating this like its The Godfather.

" The storyline played it safe
",fallyhag,26 May 2022,6,"I grew up on the original. That was my time and I loved it. The film was amazing. And still is.The sequel is good, but a little 'safe' for my liking. It didn't dare to try anything new. It just gave a lot of fan service and copy & paste story telling. Nothing will surprise you here.There are a few characters in the film but very few get used. The female love interest was pointless. She was so under used. Same for a majority of the pilots.The scene with Iceman was spot on. Emotional and well played. But the outcome was painfully obvious and a wasted opportunity.The action scenes were okay. But in this age I expect, demand, the pushing of the envelope. I didn't feel anything ground breaking here.The post attack story was laughable. Very dumb. They wanted something to happen so got drunk and just wrote it in. You really had to suspend reality to watch it. But the action to escape made up for it a little.The ending was non eventful. Dull. No surprises. Flat.Overall it was entertaining. No stand out scenes.

" Style and substance this time around
",jtindahouse,24 May 2022,8,"I admit to not being the biggest fan of the original 'Top Gun'. I found it style over substance and that isn't really what I like in a film. Yet here I was on opening night for the sequel. Such is the quality and high standard that Tom Cruise is putting into every movie he is involved in these days. I wasn't let down. This film had the style, but it also had the substance.Firstly, I thought the cast were really good. Good looking, stylish and charismatic - almost to a fault. It can come across a little arrogant and egocentric, but I think that's what you have to buy into to enjoy these films. These guys are hot-heads no doubt about it, but that's what people pay to see.There are some very good action sequences in this film. When you're watching a car chase in a movie it is very easy to keep track of where everyone is at. In a plane chase though it is very hard to get context of everyone's situation. It can be a little confusing at times but I thought the film did a good job of keeping us in the loop (so to speak) as much as they could.There's plenty of fan service to the original. I thought Val Kilmer's scene was handled very well. Touching, sweet, funny and as respectful as it could be. The film is also quite well paced. It's over 2 hours long but it never feels like it is dragging. I had a surprisingly good time with this movie. 8/10.",72 out of 124 found this helpful.
" A throwback to 1980's movies
",FeastMode,29 May 2022,6,"This is a slightly modernized version of the original. It has the same essence and feel, which is impressive after 36 years. It's enjoyable and mostly well-made with certain scenes living up to the term ""blockbuster."" It's definitely worth watching in IMAX, especially with the expanded aspect ratio.The flight scenes are once again fantastic, with the only flaw being too many cuts instead of holding on a shot. The story is investing with some good heart. The musical score is awesome. Tom Cruise somehow continues to do his own stunts, which adds a realism that we don't see as often these days. He even has a running scene like in so many of his movies. But I can't blame him, he's really good at it.On the other hand, I'm generally not a fan of 80's movies so that aspect didn't do as much for me as it will for others. And some of the nostalgia stuff feels a bit forced. They still memorize and sing the same songs 36 years later?In the end, I had a good time with this movie. Big fans of the original will love it, and casuals will be entertained. (1 viewing, early screening IMAX 5/24/2022)",41 out of 120 found this helpful.
" The definition of mediocrity
",angelsevillathethird,28 May 2022,3,"I don't know how to put this nicely... In this movie, no one is trying. The screenplay is cookie cutter/completely predictable, the characters are all the same character (cocky navy dude-even Jennifer Connolly plays cocky navy dude), the mission is vague and the stakes are non-existent.Maverick is supposed to choose 6 pilots out of a class of about 16 for this bull's eye mission. Though, only 6 of them get any screen time. I wonder who he'll pick. The inclusion of two black characters and a Latino seems progressive until they total about 5 lines of dialogue collectively. Token, much?The best part is at the climax when the ""acting"" becomes secondary to the action. The plane stunts are cool. That's literally all I have to say about this movie though. So dull. I don't know who this is supposed to appeal to, but it isn't me.

I consider this movie to be about a 6, it was entertaining if you didn't think about it too much.The performances were decent but nothing really stood out, there was not a single performance that stood out, everybody did an adequate job. I must confess to never understanding why Joe Hamm is a celebrity or has the tiniest bit of fame, that's one issue I had with the film. There were a couple of characters that were pretty annoying, none of the characters were well-developed, the writing seemed pretty poor, and on the juvenile side, and Tom Cruise's performance was about on par with everyone else. Adequate, but nothing special, just adequate. I would describe this entire movie as nothing special, just adequate.The best parts were the aerial scenes, but I don't understand why this film is considered special. It was just adequate.

" So In Case You Didn't Know...
",statuskuo,2 June 2022,3,"...Captain Maverick's real name is Pete. The reason you would know this now is that they stop the entire movie down so Penny (Jennifer Connelly) and he can repeat each others' names like it was ""Candyman"" Wish I could say ""Top Gun: Maverick"" 5 times and get my 2 hours back. This movie is abysmal laugh inducing tripe. Let's get the pleasantries out first, cool dog fights.That's it.The rest is really wooden poorly acted lines. Which would be forgiving if it weren't for the fact that all they had to do was to deliver said line in a good way. Instead, these United Colors of Benetton sad sacks seem to blurt out the fun one-liners like it was...um...real? Horrid. In order to make that work, you need a Bill Paxton in there. Instead...ugh...these young Top Gun kids who look like they've never stepped foot in the military. Yes, I understand their direction...cologne ad for 2022. Tony Scott (rest his soul) was brilliant at making slick. They essentially stole all the b-roll from the original to re-construct the beginning. I would consider that insulting as this Kosinski cat is NOOOO Tony Scott. Scott was an artist, this dude just put wall paper over his painting.I think there's a lot of ""huh?"" moments. Like what is Penny doing at an admiral's funeral. Perhaps, there to support Maverick...sorry Pete. Or, I think if you eject at mach 10.3 you'd be vaporized. But I'm no engineer. See, Petey Pete Pete seems to sidestep...the odds. Don't get me started on them going through the ""two miracles"" that need to happen in order for them to ""Star Wars"" their way into TopGun lore. Not only Petey does it, the other ones do too. I believe you non-woke folk call it ""Mary Sue?"" Roll eyes and repeat.Also missing is the typical oo-rah bombast that came with Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer. These two made the 80's. Commercials that pretended to be movies. Yes, hollow, but still casted...you know...heavy hitting actors. They attempted this with dour yet hot school marm Penny (can't forget that name) to add depth. She's dull as mud. And kills the spirit of what Top Gun was about. Men with toys.That is what woke gets you. Miles Teller pretending to be a man. The fact that there was no mention of Kelly McGillis is maddening. Yeah, we know her slow decline into obscurity, but it's still really insulting not to include...something.Now I know at this point, the box office speaks. But it tells me society is sick and tired of Marvel and DC claiming the box office. If this is the beginning of a nicer blend of lack of message movies and just getting out there and hitting dynamics of relationships that don't require spandex, than grateful for that. But this is a kick off to a hopeful era, or the end of a pathetic one.Guys, here's a manipulation trick, secrets of the set...these moviemakers inject a crowd cheering at the end to get you to cheer along. Seriously. This has been a note given in script meetings.Look, this isn't a complete waste of time. There are nods to a bygone era where things were better. You know the times this era wants to erase. Those were when America could propaganda our ways into the hearts of millions. And, it seems it's happening again. Good. America rules.

" Not bad, but waayy overrated.
",Horror_Flick_Fanatic,24 August 2022,6,"Based on the scores, I was expecting a much better film. But I now get it., its the nostalgia for the first film that fuels the scores for this film.Here is my take and why I think its an ""okay"" film, just not a great one. There really isn't a whole lot of meat and potatoes to this story. It's largely a copy pasta in large chunks from the older film but with newer,
younger faces. Maverick is charged with training a squadron of top gun fighter pilots to destroy an enemy uranium enrichment plant that is about to come online and operational. But it seems the producers want to maximize the profits for this film and not offend anyone in the real world. So this enemy doesn't have a name or a geographical location. The enemy has 5th generation fighter jets and some James Bond evil villian sized SAM batteries around the mountain's summit. It is a snow covered terrain so that rules out many enemies in warmer climates.Then there is the lone aircraft carrier delivering these jet fighters to the enemies doorstep. Well, by now most people know that wouldn't be the case. Carriers are heavily guarded and their presence would trigger the attention of any adversary. No way could four F18 sneak in under radar to blow up this plant unless we accept the enemy isn't aware of a huge freakin carrier of their shores. So there is nothing resembling a realistic scenario and that kept me from enjoying the story too much.The romantic relationship in the film has no chemistry. I just didn't feel any chemistry between Penny and Maverick. That's a first because you do have two very good looking actors and I always thought Tom Cruise to be great action actor. So no chemistry between Cruise and Jennifer Connelly is a bitter pill to swallow.What I did like about it was the cinematography and some of the action sequences with the dog fighting. But I didn't think the dog fighting were any better than the original film. In fact, the original film might have had better scenes. This film just has a lot of choppy editing to imply action.I think its a 6/10, but not a chance it's a 9/10. Maybe if they added a Tom Clancy inspired screenplay to the film I might have given it a 9. Maybe a team of seals to do recon before having the jets engage and with the aircraft carrier companied by a battlegroup flotilla. Aircraft Carriers just don't end up secretly off the shore of adversarial country completely alone, not in the real world.",72 out of 110 found this helpful.

" A great quality beefy fast food burger of a blockbuster, even if it's still a burger
",Quinoa1984,28 May 2022,8,"To convey what I think of Top Gun: Maverick properly, I'll make an analogy that will take a moment. I'm not sure if anyone has heard of the Mythical Kitchen, which is an off-shoot of the YouTube series Good Mythical Morning with Rhett and Link, but Josh from the Mythical Kitchen is quite the craftsperson when it comes to making the most gourmet fast food you've never thought about. Some examples include a ""$249 Wagyu Beef Panda Roll from Panda Express"" or ""569 Wetzel Pretzel Taste Test"" or the most recent video, ""Josh Makes a Six Foot Taco."" Josh can take a ton of ingredients, some I've never heard of and don't know what I would do with, and makes something that is absolutely spectacular looking and, of course, quite expensive - but the idea is that it's much, much more tasty and less like the school cafeteria taste you might get from your garden variety Burger King or KFC or what have you. This is all to say Top Gun: Maverick is a Josh Mythical Kitchen special where you can tell this has been made with intense, high-quality care.... does it transcend being fast food? Your mileage and/or colon may vary.First off, let's get the good things (sometimes even better than good) into this review meal (ill stop with the food analogy I swear, maybe): Tom Cruise is still a charismatic five foot seven icon for this kind of movie, where he brings much more swagger but also a lot more natural vulnerability, pathos and (maybe reading closer into it) a bit of world weariness underneath all of those decades of movie star ""I'll Go FURTHER than you... and then another step MORE"" chutzpah. So, if you want to see the movie for him more than any other reason, as I did, you'll get your money's worth.I also think he has much stronger chemistry with Jennifer Connelly- or maybe it's a better written character she gets to play, or a combo of the two- so their scenes on the whole are pleasing. And my goodness is the one scene he has with Val Kilmer one that can... well, the Berlin song isn't here this time (shock of shocks, the tiniest bit of restraint not with that song). It's certainly because the actor had his own cancer bout and so that had to be worked in to Ice, but their scene is loaded with so much dramatic energy, like you can tell how far the actors have come as stars but also as just people that it informs their scene and tops anything by a metric ton anything in the first movie for honest emotional weight.As for the new actors, they're mostly... swell. I don't know if I have a stronger word for it (ok, I like Bob and that he's just Bob and nothing more, good on you for not succumbing to a lazy nickname), buy they all fit their types - with H*ngm*n (hey, he scratched out the letters first) this movie's cocky Iceman and Rooster, Miles Teller's Son of the late Goose (is that a saying I dunno), is not.. quite Maverick or Goose, which is good, though he is saddled with the thing that we have seen in many other movies of this ilk of the son trying to live up to a father's legacy, or in this case what the best friend and confidant meant in that scenario. This isn't anywhere near the depth between Cruise and Teller that we saw in, say, Creed, but there's also not as strong or solid of a legacy to have from there anyway. Let's be honest, the death of Goose wasn't some giant mythological nexus point, it was one of those beats in a predictable action movie.Ok, I still got a little more positive, or a lot depending on your point of view, in comparison at least to 86 Top Gun; both the central plot is executed and carried out with a clearer precision (though ill get back to something that bugs me about a detail with it in a moment), as the stakes are set up from early on and the pilots are working on just that one mission, as opposed to the prior movie with it being almost more like a hang-out flick (with all those towels.. ); and the action and flying set pieces themselves are far, far more engaging and exciting, in no small part because of how film and camera tech now make it so we have a quasi verisimilitude with these actors in the planes and whether they're doing piloting or not (I suspect Cruise did because he's so bonkers, but did Bob? Shrug).And the climax of the picture is bombastic and with at least a couple of turns that I should've seen coming, if nothing else from my umpteenth viewing of Star Wars (does that make it a mild spoilers? Hell, this movie IS like a New Hope again... is it a better New Hope than Force Awakens? I'll have to sleep on that).But talking about stakes brings some issues to the table; even a gigantic hundred or several more million dollar popcorn vehicle for Cruise and company should have some politics besides 'America, good - Them, bad,' but this doesn't have that. Maybe the first movie didn't either, but that at least had the cover of the usual typical BS Reagan d-swinging Cold War poltiic where the US navy pilots could clearly be seen as engaging those kinds of targets even if not spoken. But here, we are told that ""the enemy"" is about to do a thing that will make them capable of enriching uranium. Hmm where have we heard that before in recent news? But there's no mention of any foreign adversary, like Iran or North Korea or even like Borneo or some crap. It's just... *them* and it makes it purposely vague.Maybe that will be good for audiences who don't want tricky or thorny politics into the mix, albeit its hard for me not to ponder about the times in recent years America has come so close to getting some (ie Iran) to draw back on Uranium/nuclear weapons only to be thwarted by Agent Orange and so on. I do get it to an extent, like it's hard to sell and get so many millions all over the world to watch your movie if you're pointing someone as a villain. But the vagary points to something that bugs me about the movie, which is despite all of its entertaining masculine piss and vinegar and how much one can get caught up in a sleekly shot, near perfectly edited action sequence, it's all kind of safe and impersonal deep down.Is there more to it than ""these Pilots Good, and as for you in the Snowy Mountains with your Enemy Pilots... shrug""? Or what about the personality that could be put in by a director with a little more visual panache than what's required? It's a strange note to end here, but the one thing watching the two Gunss in as many evenings is that Tony Scott really did bring a strong, smoky, Painterly-but-super-commercially attention to lighting and compositions and, as dopey and silly as it all is, a kind of rampant hormone-driven miasma to 86 Top Gun (is it gay? Sure, and that makes it *fascinating* in a bizarre way). I can't tell you a shot that tells me Kosinski stands out from several others, which is a shame as he is definitely talented, and this is better than a number of other films he's made, but...I'll close here (frankly my Kitchen metaphors made me hungry). Top Gun Maverick, for all of its bravura and, at points, heavily winking nostalgia (like the annoying thing we get now where scenes and moments replay here, with little *twists) is a $406 Whopper with extra high-grade royalty cheese, or like a $300 bag of Doritos. I love a good bag of Doritos and I can dig a Whopper. Will I feel it later? Well.... my wing name is Colon, after all.(PS: I kind of get, even though it sucks, writing off the female leads of the last movie, as Kelly McGillis was uh too tall I guess next to Cruise and Meg Ryan whatever happened to her... no Tom Skerritt? He could've popped in here, no)",34 out of 104 found this helpful.
" Take me on the mighty wings tonight ....... again.
",RedRoadster,9 June 2022,6,"I'm old enough to remember seeing the original Top Gun at the cinema in 1986. From a nostalgic point of view, I cant believe 36 years have passed between then and this sequel.The obvious observation to make is that Top Gun - Maverick is more a homage to the original film and characters than it is a sequel. The opening credits and aircraft carrier scene (with Kenny Logins Danger Zone blaring out) promises a treat but I'm afraid it falls short of expectations.The major problem is that the wise cracking one liners, over the top egos and amazing soundtrack of the original is replaced here with a paper thin plot, elementary dialogue and minor character development. Even the ""mission"" itself is something these days that would have been executed with technology and without using fighter planes. Its also really sad to see Maverick and Iceman at the end of the road and the general sense that the young men we once saw playing volleyball are now relics who have become irrelevant. There is too much use of the original as a lead in to the plot points and even having Goose's son as a big part of the story feels more nostalgic than it does necessary. Maverick's rekindled love story with Penny Benjamin at Miramar is tender but convenient, (Still working in the base bar after all these years ?) but the character is entitled to a happy conclusion to his story arc.As an action blockbuster it is really entertaining and with the cinema experience, the aerial sequences are gripping and very well done. Personally I would have liked to have seen more exterior shots during the action rather than facial closeups, but I suppose that was done to keep the characters identified during the chaotic final attack and dogfight.All in all, Its a by the numbers follow on which probably should have been made 15 years ago or not all. I'm sure part of my disappointment is how much of a pop culture effect the first one had on my generation and that this is a pale imitation compared to it. Six out of ten might seem generous, but I guess I just don't want to ""lose that loving feeling"".",66 out of 103 found this helpful.
" Terribly Missed Opportunity
",nincubura,28 May 2022,3,"I must criticize the lack of excellence by Tom Cruise. This is a high speed movie for which high frame rate is not only appropriate but DEMANDED in the 2020's. The scenes were shot on the Sony Cine Alta Venice 2 camera with 6K sensor -- that has the capacity for 59.94p at all aspect ratios.Basically, Tom Cruise put everybody through rigorous training camp, just to distribute and project 90 year old technology of 24 frams per second (FPS), for supersonic subject matter. Well guess what... for distribution at 24FPS, the editors must cut countless hours of excellent rapid motion material that was too fast for 24 FPS.When Tom Cruise says that the movie is best viewed in IMAX -- he is fraudulently lying to your face (or ears).And actually Tom Cruise is referring to ""LIE-MAX"" since true IMAX film is 18K resolution, or 130 cycles/mm at 30% response (Kodak D96 developer, ANSI Standard PH2.39-1977 (R1990) -- EASTMAN 2366 datasheet.LIE-MAX is like 64kb/s audio on an iPod. Few people actually care about REAL quality, and are bamboozled by marketing hype.A movie like this, shot at 6K resolution, looks only slightly better from an IMAX 4K Laser video projector, as it does from a standard Christie 4K projector.My advice: Wait for the High Frame Rate UHD release, and watch it at home.",30 out of 102 found this helpful.

" An Epic Blockbuster Even Better Than The Original
",cadillac20,24 May 2022,9,"Top Gun has been an 80's staple since it first released and remains a classic action film to this day. Even so, it's hard to believe they would come back to it over 30 years later. When it was first announced that this would be happening, bringing back a now nearly 60 year old Tom Cruise as character Maverick, I was highly skeptical. Shouldn't Maverick be retired by now? The trailers for the film didn't do much to sway my opinion. Then the positive reviews came in and I was still skeptical.Having seen the film, I was completely wrong. This is easily one of the years most entertaining films yet. With the completely dependable Tom Cruise not missing a beat, easily stepping back into the shoes of Maverick, and high flying, practical action that will...ahem...take your breath away, this 36-years-later sequel surprised the hell out of me.The film's overall structure is pretty similar to the original film, with lots of training at Top Gun followed by a tough mission. We meet the near dozen characters whose top tier pilots will be taking on the mission. The biggest difference here, put out early on in the film, are that the stakes are immediately raised. This is no longer just following the pilots as they train, leading into a military career. The nearly impossible mission these pilots are to be sent on is laid on the table right away. We know what's to come. There's also an emotional elements established outright, with Maverick still filled with guilt over the loss of his friend and ROI from the first film, Goose. This is compounded by Maverick having a soured relationship with Goose's son, Rooster, played by Miles Teller. We also get some familiar character types here, the most notable being Hangman, who is the pilot that most comes across as how Maverick was in the first film.The film's emotional and more visceral stakes are well established and keep the film feeling like more than just another retread of the original film, but even if you don't feel a strong connection to those aspects, you'll likely still find yourself entertained. There's no shortage of action here and it's all superb. Cruise wanted this done with practical effects and it really translates into an adrenaline pumping, well shot, exciting time. The aerial action is outstanding, shot well and trumping anything we saw in the original film. It all leads up to what is arguably one of the most exciting aviation scenes ever produced for screen.As someone who doesn't necessarily call myself a huge fan of the original film, I wasn't expecting this to be something I would like as much as I did. I figured the film would lean hard into the nostalgia and give us a little bit of action, but I should have trusted Tom more. His high standards show here and director Joseph Kosinski, who's body of work (including previous Tom Cruise collaboration Oblivion) would never suggest he would deliver something of this caliber, has certainly left a mark demonstrating his action filmmaking capability. This is a movie likely to go down as THE blockbuster of the summer, even amidst major releases like Jurassic World: Dominion, Thor, and Bullet Train. Film goers looking for an exciting, action packed good time in the theater need look no further.",52 out of 99 found this helpful.
" No one would understand the word ""cheesy"" until they've seen ""Top Gun: Maverick""
",chenp-54708,27 May 2022,5,"I saw ""Top Gun: Maverick"" with my cousin during a 4:00 p.m. Thursday Screening. I thought while ""Top Gun: Maverick"" has mighty wings and isn't boring, it didn't take my breath away. Before I explain, I wasn't fond of the original ""Top Gun"" at all simply because I didn't get to feel the need or see it through the gay way. Mainly I didn't get the chance to grow up with the 80s or be a massive fan of the 80s stuff as many others did. However, due to the positive word of mouth, I wanted to give it a chance because I like to give movies chances and I am open to surprises. Here's my takeaway:It's definitely not a bad film, that's for sure. It also ain't no cinematic masterpiece or something that is considered cinema. It's just a fun-time popcorn nostalgia-fest flick that's all.There are many impressive visual and production sets displayed throughout. The advanced technical moments when the jets are flying are impressive and the effects on the flight sequences are well done. Those moments were the selling parts of the entire film and I applaud the production, sound, designers, and stunt workers to make great action sequences. Just like the Mission Impossible action sequences, it really did help to grab the attention. Gets you to feel the need and run into the danger zone. The camerawork is also pretty good. There are many good wide shots of the environment, good shots of the jets, and some well-done camerawork once the jets are flying up in the sky. All the performances are good, but nothing really wowing. Tom Cruise is good as usual as he puts lots of effort into his work. He plays well as a pilot and military-type person. Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Ed Harris, Lewis Pullman, Glen Powell, Val Kilmer, and everyone else did their job to play well. No bad performances.But that's pretty much it since like the original, it's just another basic military action drama movie that is really really predictable. Every moment felt like something you have seen already a million times. Like you already know what is going to happen next, you already know what this character will do, what the next scene will be, and many pieces you can just easily pick up on. At times it really almost felt like a rehash of the original film but with updated technology and new characters that's all.But hey, that's what it is. Top Gun: Maverick is for nostalgia purposes and just pure food popcorn entertainment. Just to have fun. Nothing to care about in the plot. It is mainly impressive for the action and visual moments or for some people, only to see the famous celebrities rather than the narrative itself. The purpose is for nostalgia, that's all. Nothing to find anything new but to gain nostalgia or simply be entertained. I didn't really care about any characters at all. You got some of the original characters back and they are there. The loveable characters are back but in my opinion, I didn't connect with any of them as many others were able to. I didn't find Maverick likable or anyone else since the characters were bland or annoying.The original soundtrack I enjoyed but this new soundtrack was just alright. Hans Zimmer, Lorne Balfe, and Faltermeyer's scores were just alright. Lady Gaga's song for this movie just didn't work for me since I am not a fan of her music. Some of the dialogue was pretty bad. The directing was alright but nothing stands out besides the visual parts. Director Joseph Kosinski is good with visuals and CGI works as it provides with his previous films like ""Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Only the Brave"" Even tho I thought Only the Brave was fine and Oblivion and Tron: Legacy were disappointing, undeniably, Kosinski is great with what he does.Don't get me wrong. It's not a bad movie. I understand why people love this movie and why the original holds a special place in their hearts. A lot of people put their efforts and talent into this film. But at the end of the day, this movie wasn't my cup of tea. It's more for nostalgia purposes and for fans of the original. It really felt like I was watching a 2-hour military ad that is trying to tell me ""Hey Kid! Join the Navy! If these people can do it, so can you!"". At the end of the day, Top Gun: Maverick is an impressive visual fest but nothing too special. But I still enjoyed the flight sequences but that's all.But if you love this movie, that's great. I'm just a terrible person who didn't get to experience it like everyone did (I'm being sarcastic) and I'm glad you enjoyed it.",31 out of 96 found this helpful.
" Made with love
",isaacochoterena,24 May 2022,8,"This film manages to portray the best of the characters and the original story.The entire film is pure nostalgia, which reminds us of the story and characters of the original, but also giving rise to new characters and this new story, although it has many similarities with the original, the creators of this film understand all the characters and the previous film, portraying emotional and very moving moments. Some of the new characters don't get much development, but the familiar characters are just as charming as they were in the original. The scenes involving fighter planes are well done and the sound of them is spectacular, the special effects are very few, which is good, and they are good. The performances are good and can be very emotional.It is a very good sequel, since it understands the story and the original characters, as well as the emotional moments that are very significant, just as the new story is very enjoyable, this sequel makes us have more affection for these characters and the original story.",60 out of 96 found this helpful.
" Maverick with PTSD
",jb07-660-944395,27 May 2022,5,"It's a by the numbers sequel where Maverick, who supposedly got over Goose's death by throwing his dog tags into the sea, didn't. By the end of the movie it felt like I'd watched a very long comic book. A comic book that is politically correct and where even the American characters who aren't particularly nice aren't all that bad.Maverick has to train a group of hot shots while staying under the radar of a rule following Admiral who believes the day of the pilot is over and that autonomous drones are the answer to modern air warfare.The mission is to bomb an Iranian nuke site - a mission perfect for autonomous drones.So despite only lasting two months as a Top gun instructor, and being a maverick, Maverick is selected to teach a group of young pilots to carry out the mission. He teaches his team by individually shooting each one of them down in training, having them play football at the beach and telling them how difficult the mission will be - while fighting his PTSD.Despite the unreal action - Maverick treats the US Navy like his own private flying club, flying between two aircraft flying it tight formation, then spiralling towards the ground with Goose's son in the other plane - this is a slow movie.The action comes toward the end, but as America is great and Iran is bad, we don't have much to worry about. Even the enemy 5th generation fighters decide to give up their advantage of stealth and decide to engage Maverick visually.To me it felt like this film lacked the character development, twists surprises and story. So much money, time and effort has been put into a movie which is more an echo of the first, rather than being a sequel with its own kind of magic.",43 out of 94 found this helpful.

I really loved the air sequences, cannot say right now another movie to highlight in that regard. Again, air sequences are fantastic. FANTASTIC. So real, so natural view, so immersive. Sound is great and of course IMAX is recommended. I loved the cast, all of them are nice and welcomed additions. There are some very emotional scenes that worth the ticket alone. Plot, is made to enjoy. Every bit. Lovely references to prior movie and superb cinematography. Music is good, however didn't find a new classic song for my particular taste, but maybe there is one for you. Super enjoyable product, the one that put you to search where to learn to fly. Absolutely recommended to see it in theaters. So IMMERSIVE experience that not even the best home theater will match. Well, if The Godfather had The Godfather 2, Top Gun has Top Gun Maverick.",45 out of 86 found this helpful.
" I have no words
",Ralle_42,23 May 2022,10,"This is my first review, and probably only review. Ever. But this, this is something else. Im writing this when in euphoria, so please take my words with a grain of salt. But...
It's probably the best ""go-watch-this-on-a-big-screen-movie"" I have seen in a long, long time. The feeling. The nostalgia. The music. The characters. The sound of F18's. Tears of joy. Tears of sadness. Goosebumps. Roosterbumps. Damn. Everything was amazing.Last words?I feel the need. The need for speed!Update: Just saw it the 2nd time on a smaller screen and less sound. Go watch it on the biggest screen with the best sound you can find. This time my heart wasn't jumping out of my chest from the jets </3.

" Top Cheese
",danielcereto,27 July 2022,1,"I can't believe this movie is scored as 8.6, seriously I don't get it. I was expecting an action masterpiece at least, but instead I found a forgettable movie including a lot of weak points.First, the movie is super cheesy, predictable and the story is super simple. No surprises or twists from beginning till the end.Second, characters are extremely stereotyped and not well developed. Looks like more a buddys movie than anything else.Last, the nostalgia from the 80's doesn't really fit with generation Z. Everything looks really forced most of the time.So overall, if you love predictable top chessy blockbusters this one is for you. Go and watch it and score your 10.If not, try to watch some real 8.6 movies:
Seven, The silence of the lambs, City of god and Saving Private Ryan. Enjoy.",34 out of 81 found this helpful.
" A blockbuster sequel that flies higher than the predecessor.
",SAMTHEBESTEST,24 May 2022,7,"Top Gun Maverick (2022) :
Movie Review -Top Gun (1986) was a film that gave Tom Cruise a new image and a large following. It was a trendsetter for him, and probably the only second action film that got him a cult following for years after the Mission Impossible series. Tony Scott's aerial action drama was a huge hit at the box office, and people were wondering why the sequel wasn't made for years. Late sequels are usually considered unworthy, but there are a few exceptions. Now I can say, late sequels aren't worthy enough, unless it's Top Gun Maverick kind of stuff. The Top Gun sequel is too late, but it is worth the wait. I wasn't even born when Top Gun was released, but I have seen the film multiple times on TV. I recently saw it again to prepare for the sequel, and I can say out loud that the sequel has surpassed the first film. It exceeds all expectations, including the demand for scripts and advanced technologies. The age gap is filled very smartly and all the modern mass elements are put together nicely. Rather, I'd say, the action mania is much bigger and better than its predecessor.Test pilot Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell has purposely dodged an advancement in rank to continue flying after thirty-six years of service. He is summoned to train a detachment of TOPGUN graduates for a specialised mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen. Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller), call sign: ""Rooster,"" the son of Maverick's late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka ""Goose."" Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it. He meets Penny (Jennifer Connelly), a single mother, and starts a new love affair. With the help of Rooster, Penny, and other team members at Top Gun, Maverick eyes achieving an impossible mission.Top Gun Maverick fulfils all the demands of the script, challenging the disadvantages of the late sequel. Usually, the late sequels go wrong with the main characters because they damage the main source material. With Top Gun Maverick, however, the scene is different. Peter Craig and Justin Marks take care of the writing department like a newborn child. They keep the essence alive and do not harm the main character. Even the new characters aren't bad at all. The entire team is fresh and looks like a perfect fit for the new story. However, the character of Penny spoils the rhythm a bit. What happened to Charlie (Kelly McGillis), the previous love interest of Maverick? Had they given a proper explanation to that character, I think I would have loved Penny's characters even better. The second bad thing about the film is its overuse of cinematic liberty on a few occasions. You can't accept a person to be clean and alive after his jet is shot high up there. Anyway, let's not give away any spoilers. The screenplay has a turbo speed and the overall writing still clarifies the mission in a foggy atmosphere.Tom Cruise, the ageless fella. What charisma he has, especially with this character. It's a tailor-made role, and he measures all the corners perfectly. The new Maverick will make you fall in love with Tom Cruise again, and all that previous nostalgia will fade away this time. He sets the bar high this time, not just as an actor but as an on-screen persona too. I will never forget Miles Teller for his outstanding performance in Whiplash (2014), and recently he amazed me again with ""The Offer"" (2022). He plays a very predictable character here, who is in the backseat most of the time. This does not count as one of his finest roles, but he's not a big letdown either. Jennifer Connelly looks gorgeous, not better than Kelly McGillis, of course, but let's just forget that deliberated 'love interest character' for the sake of cinematic mass appeal. The roles of Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman and Ed Harris are well written and well executed. Val Kilmer may make you emotional with his cameo, while Lewis Pullman, Monica Barbaro, Charles Parnell, Jay Ellis and Danny Ramirez have got nothing new to offer, but fairly decent, indeed.What takes Top Gun Maverick a notch higher is the big-screen extravaganza. The action spectacle is brilliantly shot and tremendously well edited. The aerial action scenes are truly breathtaking, whereas the background score literally stops your heartbeat for a moment. Watching Top Gun (1986) in today's time certainly makes it look updated, but the action sequences in this sequel are designed in such a way that you will enjoy watching them even after 10 years. Yes, there are a few cliches, the comeback and all, but it's a mass market product afterall.Joseph Kosinski's previous outing with Tom Cruise - ""Oblivion"" (2013), came out as a terrible film. So, Top Gun Maverick is a terrific improvement for them. Joseph has a commendable job while dealing with the pressure of the sequel, nostalgia, and new-age improvisation. Top Gun Maverick is a top-class sequel for all the Top Gun and Tom Cruise fans out there, and the biggest credit goes to director Joseph Konsinski for that. He gambles with the idea of an aged legacy teaching something to new blood, and delivers an action-packed, blockbuster sequel by all means. Top Gun: Maverick is a big-screen experience that can't be missed. Do try to watch it in IMAX, and I'm sure it will be worth more than that expensive bowl of popcorn.RATING - 7/10*",34 out of 80 found this helpful.

" I love Tom Cruise but....
",arodriguez-97287,27 May 2022,3,"This movie was just like the first one just worse on the script. I try to watch all his movies and when I saw the first top gun, I knew I couldn't watch another 80's movie for a while, felt like I was watching the room with how corny everything was. I literally fell asleep every time Jennifer c. Would go on screen, those scenes where so useless. Then just the story was poor. In 2021(that's the time the film was originally gonna be released) that is our big mission, compared to all the Middle East air raids we had. But I will say the jet scenes are great and best part is the end, where the action is and you don't have to watch that terrible love connection that tom cruise always has in movies.

" Way better than I could have ever hoped for
",Sergiodave,26 May 2022,9,"I saw this last night on IMAX, which for this movie is a must, the sound and picture quality is pretty essential. I thought the original was great fun, a little bit too homoerotic, but well made with great flying sequences. A movie I loved as a kid in the 80's but got less enthused as I aged. This movie beats the original hands down, and I would put it in my top 10 sequels. The flying sequences are the best anyone has ever seen on celluloid, the story is a clever one, which I won't spoil, but is full of little surprises. The cast are all great and the directing from Joseph Kosinski is amazing. I'll go to the cinema 40+ times this year and I strongly doubt I'll see a better blockbuster in 2022. Well done.

" So glad I saw this film.
",hfreinoso,3 June 2022,10,"I was never anticipating Top Gun Maverick. I thought Top GUn was good, but not great. I couldn't care less about the film, but most people and my friends said it was amazing. So I went to see it. And sure enough, it was one of the best experiences I have ever had on the big screen while watching this, and holy sherbert was this a film to have and has no right to be this level of good.Pros: Because Rarely do you get a sequel that measures well against a Blockbuster like what Top Gun was. But I have to say, and excitedly, Maverick does just that. I enjoyed the action here, great stunt flying by this highly skilled team of aviators because this action was the best action I have seen in a long time. I take it back because the action and suspense were breathtaking. Never had I wanted to beg someone to make it out of life in the most messed up and dangerous situation. The cast was great; Jon Hamm stood out to me as a big presence. Jennifer Connelly looked fantastic; the romance scenes were extremely tasteful and did not detract from this film's core 'action.' The cinematography was first-rate, and the story was solid; the acting was spot on. Jerry Bruckheimer preserved the magic, and There was enough reference material in the movie to remind or retell the original story for those who had not seen Top Gun keep everyone up to speed. Bringing back Val Kilmer was a nice touch as well. The great story they put together to work that in. But Maverick and Rooster were the show stealers of this film; their problems with each other were like a father trying to protect and reconnect with his son. A big plus is that there were more PRACTICAL EFFECTS than CGI. One thing in the modern era where everybody loves to use CGI instead of practical, this was a huge plus for me.Cons: Nothing much, but I wish there were even more action scenes, as they were all good and entertaining.Overall, the film was outlandish; they made me like this with some breathtaking action, and I couldn't believe I would skip this film. But I was so glad I saw it on the big screen. 10/10. Perfect.",46 out of 75 found this helpful.
" So epic it will make you shed a tear
",loveasklin,26 May 2022,10,"One of the most epic blockbuster movies ever put on the big screen. If you're a fan of the predecessor, you will love this. A perfect mix of nostalgia and new. New fans will also be blown away. Whatever you think of Tom Cruise, this is impressive. It's beautiful, touching and epic.This is what the big screen is made for. Huge, epic, and breathtaking action scenes with crazy sound design. The cinematography, the stunts, and the sound design combined make for an unforgettable experience. The seats were shaking and I shed a few tears from watching the action. It was just too awesome.The action is unlike anything you have ever seen. The action sequences are immersive, nerve-racking, and epic. It's difficult to explain the feeling, but I never knew I was capable of feeling this way.When Maverick's flying, the seats are shaking and the sound is booming. It looks stunning and knowing that Tom Cruise is actually in the cockpit makes it so much better. Tom Cruise's dedication is something else. He put the other actors through a pilot training course and teached them how to direct themselves in the cockpit. Whatever projects Tom Cruised has touched in recent years has turned out to be absolute gold. Entertainment does not get better than this.Tom Cruise and Miles Teller put on a show. Phenomenal acting from both. Teller was the perfect casting for Maverick's deceased best friend's son. ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is more than just breathtaking action. It's about family and legacy. Tom Cruise waited for the perfect script until he made the sequel, and it was well worth the wait. It's a beautiful story with layered and realistic characters, which will make you wonder who's shredding onions in the theater. Some moments are predictable, but that doesn't ruin anything.Don't think, DO watch this movie in theaters. It is quite the ride. You don't want to miss the sound design, visuals, and feelings this movie makes you feel.",38 out of 74 found this helpful.

",leftbanker-1,17 August 2022,1,"Relentlessly corny and embarrassing at every step.Mav comes back to fight the Antifa Air Force, but this time they have an ace up their sleeve: They have joined forces with the Black Lives Matter army, In the final dogfight, it's Maverick against Hillary Clinton. Who will prevail?Isn't rooster just another word for chicken?Almost every word of dialogue in this film was embarrassing to listen to. ""Talk to me, dad."" Wow, that was just horrible.This is simply a torrent of smarmy, treacly cliches, mostly coming from the original.The film is pretty awful in spite of all the voices in the media shouting about how it has saved the movie industry. If Top Gun is the solution, perhaps movies aren't worth saving.We begin with nostalgia for the original, and much of this new film is just piling on debris on the ruins of the older version. Rooster holds a grudge against Maverick because of what happened to his father when he was like, three years old? And it was determined that Maverick wasn't at fault? Makes zero sense. Unless Mav was also some sort of pervy uncle.Mav trashed an aircraft that is probably worth $35 million just because of his ""need for speed"" yet doesn't end up in jail for his stupidity.Was the football orgy as homoerotic as the volleyball game in the original? Only you can decide that.Evidently, Mav has a girlfriend. I would imagine that sex for him is just high-fiving and chest-bumping because his true love affair continues to be with Ice.

" Awful and ridiculous movie ,doesn't worth a penny
",baharmortazavian,28 June 2022,1,"Watched this movie recently and one thing to mention is that it is not even a movie. It is barely a commercial for the US army with a simple and plain story, full of ridiculous dialogues. As someone who lives in the middle east, I can say that there is absolutely no natural environment as the one displayed in the movie in any of the middle eastern countries including Iran. It is obvious that they didn't do any investigation about there. Not worth a penny.

" Underwhelming and unnecessary
",ashishagupta,25 August 2022,5,"There seem to be an overwhelming number of fake reviews on IMDB aimed to boost theater ticket sales. Unfortunately this highly anticipated film is a typical 5/10 action movie sequel.The writing and screenplay make film school 101 blunders, like violating the principle of show don't tell. After one ""viewing"", a blind person could describe this movie as well as a non-blind person.The plot development is campy and over the top, typical of cheesy action movies. The character development is forced down your throat, doesn't work.The casting for this movie is inexplicably bad.The number of plot holes and illogical nonsense tends to infinity.A key point in the original movie was that Maverick is actually a very disciplined pilot who pushes it to the limit of what is required. Notwithstanding appearances, he is actually very considerate of his colleagues.This sequel completely misses the point. Maverick is now an undisciplined showboating pilot. In a similar vein this sequel, despite appearances, is actually inconsiderate of the original film.",42 out of 71 found this helpful.

" Can't remember the last time I smiled so much in the cinema!
",Joxerlives,28 May 2022,8,"This was just such FUN! When I was leaving the cinema people were openly saying how good it was and I had to agree. Ok so large part of it don't make much sense, why do they have to attack with such a small force (in a scenario straight out of Star Wars), why not have the rest of the squadron perform flak suppression on the SAM sites? Lots of homages to the first film not to mention 'The Right Stuff' but had to admit was on the edge of my seat when Mav went to Mach 10. Great gag when he walks into the diner in his burnt flight suit and asks where he is only for the kid to reply ""Earth!"". I think the romance between Mav and Penny was good although I far preferred her before her reduction surgery. Shame they couldn't have got Kelly McGillis back to play Iceman's wife, would have been an nice touch. Speaking of which that was the most emotional part of the film (far more so than all the daddy stuff), seeing Cruise and Kilmer together in a situation that wasn't too far from real life, I highly recommend everyone watch the documentary 'Val' although it is rather heart-breaking. So was it cheesy? Yes, very much so. But was it 2 hours of action, 1980s nostalgia and first rate entertainment? Yes and I would highly recommend it.",42 out of 69 found this helpful.
